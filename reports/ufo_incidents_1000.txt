{"text": "place in early 1977 at the Georgia Academy for the Blind in Macon.  It was a residential school for the blind back then, and there were four students per room. On this particular day, I awoke sometime between five and six in the morning, and as was so often the case, I simply decided to lie there until it was time for our house parent to awaken us at 6:30.   All of a sudden I heard from across the room what I can only describe as a sort of trumpet fanfare.  It came from high on the wall.  I\u2019m guessing there was only a second between the fanfare and the startling thing that happened next.  I heard my dear, sweet friend suddenly emerge from the exact place where the music came from.  It sounded to me as though he simply came through the wall, and he was sobbing as he was turned over in mid-air and then dropped on his bed.  He cried for a few more seconds before he went to sleep.   I can assure you I did not go back to sleep.  I can also say that the boy who slept in the bed next to mine had also been wide awake, and he heard the sound of a brass fanfare too.  I know he did, because I overheard him later that day humming under his breath the exact notes that had come from high on the wall.   I never did ask my dear, sweet friend what happened to him.  After all we were only seven years old at the time.   The following school year I heard that he had moved to another state, so I never got the chance to ask him about this terrifying experience.  Who in the world (or from another world) would have taken my friend out of his bed in the middle of the night, and where did they take him.  Whatever they did to him made him sob, and whoever brought him back just dropped him on his stomach on the bed.   I would gladly answer any further questions you might have about this most unsettling experience from early 1977. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Thanks so much, Peter, for getting back in touch with me as quickly as you did.   I have been carrying around this story inside my head for forty years, all the while wondering who would believe such a thing.  The person who overheard the sound of the brass fanfare and who rehearsed it perfectly later that day is name ((name deleted)).  He presently lives in Atlanta.  In a phone conversation seven years ago, I asked him if he any recollection of the incident.  Alas, he had no memory of the experience.   The primary person in the story is named ((name #2 deleted)), and I wouldn't even begin to know how to contact him.  It seems as though his father was in one of the branches of the U.S. military, and was connected in some way to the State of Alaska.  I did not report the incident to anyone at the Academy For The Blind, and as far as I know, ((name #1 deleted)) didn't report it either.    In all your years of gathering and sorting through U.F.O. stories, have you ever heard anything like what happened to ((name #2 deleted)) in March of 1977?   Most curious of all in some respects was the brass fanfare ((name #1 deleted)) and I heard just before ((name #2 deleted)) materialized in mid-air.  What occurs to me now even as I type this is the possible link between ((name #2 deleted)) having been abducted, and his father's serving in the military.   Blessings to you, Rev. ((name deleted))  ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Hey, Peter,   In whatever way my story might be helpful to the U.F.O. community, my heart would be gladdened by it.  Of course, let me know if there is anything else I might contribute to the burgeoning literature on abductions.   One question for you, (and it's probably one you get all the time), will I ever know what happened to ((name deleted--abductee)) that morning?  What was it I heard back in 1977?

{"text": "My wife and I were watching the sun go down, facing west, on a cloudless evening.  I noticed a very bright, relatively spherical, light hovering in the same spot for about 5 to 8 minutes due west.  It is difficult to say exactly where it was hovering, because I have no idea how large it actually was, so perhaps somewhere between Adelanto and Lancaster.   It was not especially high in the sky, appearing just over the view of the homes across the street from us, no higher than an average helicopter height, but it did not move at all like a helicopter, nor did it have any sound.  If it had been a helicopter it would have been closer to where we sat based on the perspective of its position and relative size to the homes and we would have heard a sound, seen its lights and the manner that it moved.   It began to slowly change directions and altitude getting higher and heading north. As it did, the light extended out looking more like a rocket's contrail; however you could faintly see a dark elongated shape in front of the contrail.  It did not accelerate quickly or move in an exaggerated way, rather it steadily gained altitude, steadily moved in a north-easterly direction, and the contrail continued to elongate and stayed quite bright almost white.  In other words although it resembled a rocket's contrail it never had a fiery look.  As it reached a zenith height of what I estimate to be approximately 10 to 15 miles its contrail began to fade until it simply faded out and vanished.  There were no clouds to obscure it, no darkness to cover it, it simply disappeared, but slowly as if it were erased bit by bit.   I know of no known rocket that can hover and then proceed to leave the atmosphere at such a relatively slow controlled pace, let alone disappear or fade out.", "stats": "Occurred : 8/8/2017 19:30  (Entered as : 08/08/17 19:30) Reported: 8/9/2017 8:57:34 PM 20:57 Posted: 8/11/2017 Location: Victorville, CA Shape: Changing Duration:20 minutes", "date_time": "8/8/17 19:30", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135628.html", "city": "Victorville", "state": "CA", "shape": "Changing", "duration": "20 minutes", "summary": "My wife and I were watching the sun go down facing west on a cloudless evening.

{"text": "It seemed almost as if there was a car in the sky. My friend and I were swimming at night and having a good time, while my dad was on the steps of my back porch, trying to replace a step.  We were talking, being slightly loud.  I looked behind some trees, over a few houses and saw two extremely bright lights, in the shape of car headlights.   For a few seconds, I brushed it off as an airplane type I had never seen before.  I calmly pointed at the aircraft, telling my friend to look.  When she turned around, the aircraft suddenly started moving to the right.  Not like a normal plane, it wasn't at a steady pace.  It looked like a car that was breaking down, but it was level to where it was before.  Then it started moving faster and faster to the right.  I screamed and told my dad and friend to get inside.   My friend and I struggled to get out of the pool, but I kept my eyes on the aircraft.  It turned to the side, the lights then faced away from me, and went behind some trees.  Two other lights, seemingly on the a! ircraft appeared.  They were purple and green, much smaller and nowhere near as bright as the lights before.  I waited for the aircraft to come out from the other side of the trees, but it didn't.  I kept a close eye on it.  My dad calmed us down, and we went back into the pool.   Jets and planes fly over my house a lot, but this one had an unfamiliar route and was too close to the ground to be an airplane trying to land, there were no airports close enough.  Jets in my area have a square light  formation, of white, red, and sometimes yellowish lights.  Planes, however, with my airport, typically have red and/or blue lights.  Pretty much any lights besides green and purple.  Not to mention, the two brightest lights on planes typically are on the front, and are white.   Yes, that matched the discription, but how exactly did the plane remain still, and move to the right when it's front was facing us?  If it was a plane, the lights on it's front would've been facing us, so I understand why it would appear still, but that doesn't really explain why it moved sideways, with no hesitation or normal movement of any other planes.   Anyway, we were back in the pool.  Trying to have a good time, and ignore what we saw.  I kept a close eye on the spot between the trees the entire time.  I turned to talk to my friend, then spun back around and saw the lights again... in the exact same spot.  I screamed my friend's name as I rushed out of the pool.  The aircraft did the exact same thing once again.   When I was talking to my dad about it, who was trying to convince me it wasn't a UFO, for my good night sleep's sake, I pointed behind him and there it was again.  It then, moved to the right, and disappeared behind the trees.   I feel as if we were being spied on.  Every time I pointed at it, or started screaming, it left, then returned when I wasn't looking.  It's incredible, but I've been followed by too many things like this.  Also, no noise followed it.

{"text": "Loud strange noise in the sky over Peachtree Corners, Georgia. This morning, Friday, July 28, 2017, around 11 am, I was sitting at my computer in my back bedroom.  I could hear this strange noise far off and I was wondering what it was.   At first, I thought maybe it was an airplane, but the sound was just so odd, I remain sitting as the sound became louder, I wanted to get up and go look out my sunroom window (like I usually do}, but for some reason, I just couldn't move!  As the noise got louder, I could tell that it was coming closer to my location and it was moving fast.   Finally I jumped up and ran into my living room and looked out my sunroom window, by the time I reached my window I could tell that it was passing over my apartments and moving fast.  Once I pulled back my blinds I notice that the sky was hazy and there were 2 Gwinnett County Police Officers facing in my direction and looking in the sky.   First, I was surprised because I had no idea that the Police was outside, and secondly I immediately notice them looking up in th! e sky with a shocked look on their faces.  They seems shocked and confused and one of them had his mouth open like WTH is that!!   I noticed that the noise had all of a sudden stopped and I could no longer hear it.  I tried to scan the limited amount of sky in my view and that's when I noticed how \"Hazy\" the sky was.  I watched the Police for a few minutes to see what they was going to do.  They both stayed focus on the sky and finally turn to one another and started talking, after a few more minutes of talking, one got into his car and left and went to another locations by the security gates.   The second Police officer stayed behind for a few more minutes, and then they both followed each other out the complex.  I have no idea what they were looking at, but I'm certain that whatever that weird loud noise was in the sky, they saw it!  No doubt in my mind because I can't forget the shocked look on their faces!!   After they left, I called my cousin, who had gone to Publix grocery store to see if he heard that strange LOUD noise because I cou!d tell that it was coming from that direction (141& Holcomb bridge) toward me (Holcomb bridge Rd toward Peachtree Corners).  He immediately said that they could hear it, but no one knew what it was!!  There is a lot of strange objects in the sky in the Peachtree Corners area, on any day at any time you can witness them.  I noticed that if you have sunglasses on, you will be able to see them clearly,  I have taken my sunglasses off and I could barely see them, but once I put them back on, I can plainly see them.  They do disappear, which makes it hard to capture them on video or take pics.  I don't worry too much because I know I will see them again because they are ALWAYS flying around.

{"text": "A strange object in the sky above mount benson. So, I am recalling all of this almost a year later, but there were quite a few witnesses there with me that night and I think it would be interesting to compare our experiences.   I was living in south Nanaimo with 3 of my friends as roommates, and we were housing a couple friends who had been traveling.  Our house had a deck on the second floor with a great view of mount benson from south nanaimo.  We were all hanging out on the deck as it got dark we noticed a bright light like you would see on a plane stationary in the sky above Mount Benson.  This light was very bright and it was hovering in the sky at about the level smaller planes fly at.   We took a look at the object through a pair of binoculars and although it was hard to keep steady I could make out yellow red and blue lights along the outer edge of a disc shaped object that looked as though it was spinning.  I could see the different colored lights rotating around the edge of the object.  Beneath it looked li! ke glowing blue tentacles resembling a jellyfish's.  All my friends looked at the object through the binoculars and saw the strange spinning disc.   The object stayed in the sky for the next few hours as we lost interest.  About 3 hours after we first noticed the UFO my friend and I were sitting outside again and I was drawn to look at the object again.  Just then, I saw a huge bolt of lightning shoot up FROM THE MOUNTAIN towards the UFO.  The lightning bolt stopped a few stories below the object, and I alerted my friend, asking if she had seen it, and in the next moment a huge flash of light in the sky above the UFO.  My friend saw the second flash of light and we watched for awhile, after that, but there were no further flashes.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  There was no sound coming from the object.   It continued to hover in the same spot for a couple weeks, with no movement or further flashes of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was difficult to determine altitude.  I'd take a guess and say higher than most man made aircraft. The event only lasted about twenty too thirty seconds.   I never forget the experience.  I tell people, and they think I'm making up the whole UFO experience.  I know what I've seen up in the heavens.  We're not allown.

{"text": "Multiple flashes of light of varying intensities and duration in random locations overhead (The first 4 seconds of the video are stars.)  I have an extensive aviation and aerospace background enough to know the differences in airborne craft and their flight peculiarities, if any. I was a pilot in the past.  I know all about Wright-Patterson as per Roswell, as my gramps used to work there in the 1950's-1980's.  I know what satellites and space junk in orbit look like, too.  This is not a spent Soviet rocket booster. I've seen this thing in multiple states since around 2012 at least.  It makes no sound.  This thing follows no linear path and has only one light that shines and/or flashes at irregular intervals at varying intensities.  The flashes look like fireflys as the flashes occur in random positions, but are much too bright, and I can tell they are way higher up than firefly altitude. Often, the light flashes bright-enough to rival Venus or Sirius, or perhaps even brighter. If it were a small, kit aircraft, it would have to be low enough to be able to hear, like around 5000' AGL.  If a small kit aircraft managed to get up to 14000' or higher, air would run thin. Maybe the pilot is on oxygen.  But at those altitudes the angular separation between each flash is far enough apart, that speed required to be in the following flash position would greatly exceed that of a single-engine prop. There is no reason why some pilot would be up above this country area in rural Ohio with no wingtip navigation (green/red) lights (against FAA regulations) flashing a single light in a strange manner. I thought it may be an experimental military craft, or some kind of exercise going on, as often when I see this thing, there is a commercial airliner nearby at cruising altitude (above 18000').  But I have seen these flashes with multiple witnesses who multiple times from coast to coast for about the last seven or eight years, often in parts of the country where there are no fireflys. I will edit a video of this, also. I suspect that I will be able to film them again soon. I am almost scared to admit to the general public that I believe I can see the flash and \"talk\" to it.  I will say \"can I see another, please?\" and it will flash brightly. I wait ten or fifteen seconds and I say \"gimmie another one!\" and it will flash again very brightly right after I ask. I sh*t you not. I am of very scientific mind and I don't generally believe in such a thing, so it is kind of concerning me that I seem to be able to request a flash, and then have it shine or flash very brightly.  It's kinda creeping me out. Like I said, I will try to do this more in the future.  This is the first time I have filmed it on hi-def or at all for that matter, and the first time I have ever had a camera good enough to even film anything at night, and I hope to improve my filming skills in the coming nights. I have seen it so many times over the years and made it flash by asking, that I am pretty sure I can get the same result again.  As I was filming this, I held the camera still as possible. I zoomed in 50% at some point about half-way through and left it there.  Only once did I quickly move it a few degrees to show an airliner as you can hear me say on the video.  I moved it back to the general vicinity.  So if you see a flash in the bottom right corner, for instance, and then one in the center, this is not due to me moving the camera.  The flashes actually occurred in separate spots relative to each other. Some flashes were quite faint, others were longer than a flash, increasing in brightness slowly over the course of a couple seconds, peaking in brightness, and then slowly dropping off.  Some moved when flashing slowly.  Others were stationary quick flashes.  The next flash would be very bright and quick, for instance.  Each flash was somewhat different.  When you hear me say, there's a bright one, the camera did not do it justice.  It was actually much brighter than the camera reveals. My guess is maybe a drone(s), or perhaps it is above the atmosphere (over 100km), which would make it huge, and fast.  I'm not sure of the altitude.  If I had to bet my life on it, I would guess between 20000'-50000' AGL maybe?  But it certainly could have been at orbital altitude, even. I'm not sure. Maybe it's a drone that can listen in through a cellphone, to explain why it flashes when I ask it to?  Maybe just some government employees messing with me, maybe? :D  I've been tricked before on more than one occasion by perspective regarding UFOs, so I believe I am more careful to discern this, these days.  I'm not saying it's ETs or anything, I'm saying I don't have a clue and I want to know.  I will search for similar sightings by others after typing this.

{"text": "Strange disc shaped object flying over highway 41 near the Arboretum in Chanhassen, MN. We were driving north on highway 41 between Lyman Avenue and 82nd Street in Chanhassen, MN, when we saw an object floating through the air over the road, going west to east.  Although the sun had set, there was still plenty of light to see and the sky was still bright.   The object was an oval shape with dark edges and a center the color of the sky.  It was about at a height that I would expect a kite or flock of ducks.   So, at first we thought it was a smoke ring or flock of birds or a giant balloon.  However, as we drove closer, and it continued to move over us to the east, it became clearer that it was a very distinct disk or saucer.  Since we were right under it, the oval shape we saw in the distance had changed into a circular disk form.  Again the edges were clearly visible as a dark outline against the sky and the middle was now similar to a reflection of the sky, but more muddled and it included a swirl of feint lights. My wife and I were stunned in the front seats and I slowed the car down as there were no other cars immediately behind us.  As we passed underneath and it continued to move east,  I accelerated and made a right turn on 82nd and into the immediate parking lot on the right side.

{"text": "Star like objects in near space visible from Spokane Valley. I observed two closely spaced (in time and space) sightings on July 4th.  First object crossed sky, a point source, star like, about the brightness of Saturn, following an arc from about Arcturus in Bootes across the face of the moon (or behind?) and disappeared near the planet Saturn.  Assuming the object fell into Earth\u2019s shadow, it was slightly higher than LEO.  From the fact this object was noiseless, covered the distance in about 12 seconds and using the ISS for reference it was travelling about 80 miles/second, or about 5 times orbital escape velocity in LEO. The next series of star like objects occurred about 10:05 (p.m.?), when I noticed a bright object, about 5 moon widths to the west of Zubeneschamali in Libra, after noticing this first object, about the brightness of Saturn.  Within a second or two, two dimmer objects, the first about \u00bd degree north of Zubeneschamali, the second directly north about 3 moon widths.  The effect was to create an isosceles triangle, with the base composed of two dimmer stars and the brighter star at the apex forming a triangle pointing to the west.  The three objects slowly moved to the north, but disappeared before moving a Moon\u2019s width (1/2 degree) and within 2-3 seconds of the 10:05 sighting of the apex star like object. I have verified there were NO satellites of sufficient magnitude to have been mistaken for the objects.

We were near Yelm, a town on a prairie plateau in the South Puget Sound area, with a big sky view. The color was silver white, with a long bright white needle like tail much longer than I have ever seen with a meteor.  It had inside the small super bright oval shape a small faint green color to the core with a very short green tinting into the beginning of the tail.  The green was only by the object itself, it did not bleed into the tail more than about 5% of the overall length with its full tail. This is more conducive of a missile, than a meteor, in that its magnitude never changed.  The light was identical to the light of small missiles, such as patriot missiles, but much faster, and much longer.  As for the flare of missiles right at the front of the propulsion fire we couldn't see well, it was too far off, but it appeared to have a faint flare to it, not quite doubling it thickness at that point only, it didn't trail at all, almost like just a blur around the start of the burn area. This did not look at all like a meteor after initially seeing it, and it appeared to be about 40,000 to 70,000 alt., and if so, would put the speed about mach 10.  I flew flight test in Lear's, and I know what I saw.  It did not appear to change altitude in the least. Furthermore, EVERY meteor I have seen acted identically the same.  This was only fast and bright, no other similarities to meteors. It DID NOT flare up and fade off as meteors do.  It DID NOT have the orange and particulates that flare off meteors in about the middle of their entry to our atmosphere.  There were no sparks or glittering.

But here is an account of the incident.  I fell asleep on my couch in Columbus, OH at around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on 7-8-17.  Then I woke up on my back, inside of what I equated to being an enclosed tanning bed-like apparatus.  It felt as if I was traveling at a high rate of speed and the ride was very turbulent.  I began to look around and one of the things I remember seeing is a worn down \"yellow labeling\" on the inside of whatever the hell I was enclosed in.  The next thing I know, at least my head was no longer enclosed as I saw an alien take an object and touched my forehead with it and I was \"out cold\".  I woke back up on couch in the exact same position I fell asleep on with my CPAP on just as it was prior to this \"possible abduction\".  I had no fear, not sure why..  In the ensuing minutes after waking up I tried to make sense of what had happened.  There was no missing time, I was back up within a half hour. Had a sick like feeling in my stomach, open waking up and its been on and off all day. Description of the alien I saw:  Structurally, it was similar to many of the common air craft aliens we see in our American pop culture documentaries (Short around 3 feet, thin body, big dark eyes, funny shaped head) accept this one had rather dark scaly skin, not true gray.  One the the things that stood out was the wide of its arm and forearm, it was the equivalent of a broomstick width the arm was the same width as the forearm.  I was unconscious seconds after he put the object between my eyebrows and forehead. Other information about me which you may or may not find relevant. Since the age of 8 years old I have been an experiencer of sleep paralysis -entity attacks, but even before this the paranormal world seemed to antagonize me at a really young age.  I can remember some things just before the age of two.  I've had thousands of negative nocturnal (non physical) attacks by paranormal entities, like smacking, prodding, choking and senses manipulation (I've also had a few positive ones like when I was tapped on the shoulder after falling asleep while feeding my infant son a bottle which caused the nipple to go adrift from his mouth.   Lately, I'd say within the last year, I've seen very bright lights in my dreams on more than one occasion.

{"text": "Star like orb flashing colors in night sky. Well, I was working nights on a drilling rig in Pinedale, WY.  Elevation is about 7,500 ft, and 100 miles from any big towns, so I get to see a lot of the night sky.   While I was in the back yard of the drilling rig, I looked up and noticed a star-like figure, which hadn't been there the last 14 nights.  I started really looking closely at the object, and noticed it changing colors...red, blue, white.   I instantly thought, well, maybe it's a plane or drone, but seemed to high of altitude, considering the mountains around me were 11,000 ft higher then the horizon.  I called my co-worker on the CB radio, and said hey check this out.  And he responded \"what\"  I jokingly said, the UFO in the sky.  He also brushed it off as a plane, or some commercial aircraft, until it didn't move like any plane.   We then began radio chatter which got a few other employees attention as well and they came to the back of the drilling rig to see what all the UFO talk was about.   As we talked, we came to the conclusion maybe it was some kind of satellite.  We also had a debate about maybe being some kind of planet in our solar system, but that would explain the size and color changing orb that it was.  So I went about my work day ever now and then I glanced at it and it stayed in the sky until 5:30 am, when the sun came up.   I got off work around 7:00am, and started my travel back home heading to Casper, WY.  through he south pass of the mountain, and saw some pretty out of the ordinary traffic.  At least 20 white cargo vans all following each other, heading towards the area we had seen the UFO.  4 of the vans had trailers, 2 black enclosed trailers, and the other two had flat bed bumper pull trailers with telescopes.  I then thought to my self, well maybe it was some kinda of planet, or some kind of star searching club was going to check the night sky out.   Finally reaching my house in Casper, Wyoming, slept the day away, because I was working nights for the past 14 days.  I then told my girl friend what crazy things I saw at work and the way home.  She kinda gave me a look like that's crazy, or maybe your crazy.  But we stepped foot outside our house and seen 3 star like orbs again flashing in the night sky.  Did a little research on the internet and I am not only the only one who has seen something like this but there is videos on YouTube of the same orb like figure.  One orb faces southeast one west, and one south west.

{"text": "Seven very, very bright, blinking lights quietly crossed the sky above us in almost a single-file line. Sitting with one other person on our balcony...looking east.  Partially cloudy sky that night. Other person points and says \"what is that?!!\"  I look up, seeing seven very bright lights, traveling in a nearly straight line, traveling in a north to south direction, at about a 50% angle from the horizon, above us. The lights were much brighter than the brightest star in the sky--perhaps 10 times or more brighter. My first reaction was one of being very startled and concerned.  This did not look like anything I had EVER seen in the sky before...and I was at first concerned it was something dangerous.  After it continued past us, I was less concerned, and just very curious at what it was. The lights did not make any sound that we could hear...and the night was overall quite quiet.  The lights continued on their path, coming in and out of the clouds in a southern direction, for about 6 minutes or so...as they faded out of view and into the clouds in the distance. Hard to get a good read on their altitude, but they were significantly higher than the relatively low clouds that night, and perhaps a fair bit higher.  If I had to guess, I would say 5,000 - 15,000 feet.  But again, I'm no expert at altitude distances. Unfortunately, both of our phones were charging in the other room, and by the time we thought to get pictures, the lights were out of sight. To describe the lights in more detail:  Seven (maybe 8) very bright, white lights, maybe 10 times brighter (or more) than the brightest star in the sky, traveling in a nearly straight-line formation across the sky.  They were traveling in a nearly single-file line, with a couple of the lights slightly out of line. The lights were very close together -- all 7 seven of the lights were approximately contained in the outline of my fist when my arm was completely outstretched.  They seemed to be traveling at the approximate speed of an airplane.  They were traveling at a constant speed.

{"text": "Bright orange fireball Vero Beach, FL 4-15-17 1:45 AM At approximately 1:45 AM Eastern Time, I was walking my dog, and as usual, stargazing.  As I walked down 40th Ave., towards 12th Street in Vero Beach, Florida, I saw a large fireball appearing light falling to earth, at approximately 45 Degree angle, but curving, not coming straight down.  The ball of light lit the clouds orange, as it went behind the cloud and below the tree line, and out of sight.   There was no sound at all and I watched the area of the sky for another 10 minutes, but I saw nothing more.  It looked like the video of the Russian Chelyabinsk Meteor that came down in 2013, before the explosion and nowhere near as bright but the trajectory as this orange ball of fire was on a very similar angle.   I did not see a tail or trail behind it, and it appeared to move at a uniform speed, but slower than one would expect a meteor to fly.   This was amazing to watch, I hope I can find out more out about it.   I noticed my dog that is a wolf hybrid, seemed mesmerized, and watched it, as I did, until lost from our sight.

{"text": "Two sets of two orange-red spheres following the same path While walking the dog in our back yard, I saw a bright orange-red light appear over the western horizon, traveling toward the east.  The light was bright and steady, not pulsating, and the object made no sound.  I watched it travel across the dark sky, trying to determine what it could be.   Then another identical object appeared from the same area as the first one, and followed the same path.  One object was trailing the other.   When both objects were clearly visible at the same time, I ran to the house to ask my husband to come outside quickly.

There was a distance between them but they followed the same trajectory.  The trailing light passed into a small thin cloud and disappeared first.  Then the leading light passed into a larger, more dense cloud and dis! appeared second.  Then they were gone. After that, the sky seemed clear except for a passing airplane.  I resumed walking the dog and then to our surprise, about two minutes later, another orange-red light just like the first two appeared, again from the same area on the western horizon and traveling eastward.  My husband was still outside and witnessed it, too.   About 30 seconds later, there came another light from the same place.

In terms of illumination, the object/light resembled Saturn in both brightness and magnitude, although the quality of its light was a steady pale white while lit.  There light definitely wasn't a flash like that of a strobe, and it wasn't like the brilliant reflected light of a planet like Jupiter or Saturn.  It had no star-like characteristics, either.

The lights were attached to something very large and were blinking in the clockwise sequence around an object.   The area that these lights covered took up most of the horizon.  The area around the lights was totally blacked out, you could see no stars or the moon at all.   While I watched the object and lights, it did not appear to be moving.  If it was moving it appeared to be doing so very slowly.  The loud humming sound was definitely coming from the direction of the lights.  It was a very odd sound, not like an airplane.  The sound was more like a pulsing hum, but very loud.  In fact, you could feel the vibration from the sound.   After watching the object for a couple of minutes, I ran and got my Dad out of bed so he could see this as well.  My dad brought his cell phone with him so we could try to film this.

We are about half a mile from a boat launch on Lake Roosevelt.   My mom and I were watching tv at 23:55 or 11:55pm, when my step dad walks inside the house from the porch.  He says to my mom, \u201cCome listen to this noise, I have never heard anything like it.\u201d   So my mom goes outside with him on the porch.  I do not follow him at first because he was so calm.  Then my mom opens the door and frantically calls out to me, \u201cCome out here as fast as you can!\u201d   I run out to the porch and instantly see this long string of lights in the sky, and there is this loud, ominous, deep vibrating sound that I can feel vibrating though my feet on the deck.  The only way I would be able to describe this sound would be if there was a giant wine glass with a mile wide rim, and a wet finger continuously rubbing along the rim to make this deep low hum. The string of lights are white and flashing or pulsating in what appeared to be a sequence running around the perimeter of a disk.  We could not see the definite outline of the craft because it was dark and also very smoky from recent fires.  But we could tell by the pattern that the lights were moving that it was most likely a disk or ring shape.  The craft looked like it was about a mile long, and maybe 1,000 feet above lake Roosevelt.   We first saw the craft to the east, moving very very slowly.  Its path appeared to be following the curves of lake Roosevelt, headed north, then north west.  We could still hear the hum or vibration from the craft about three or four minutes after it was out of view.  I was in such shock that I could not stop crying my eyes out.   My mom tried to calm me down by reminding me that the day before this event, or maybe two days before, the local news station gave a statement from the local air force base, Fairchild Air Force Base, saying that people should expect to see strange aircraft maybe even foreign crafts.  But the broadcast was almost in a joking manner.   This changed my mood from scared and sad to scared and mad.

{"text": "Red orange, glowing egg shaped orbs hover in formation and fly away single file. I was watching television in my family room when I noticed some strange, bright red orange lights in the distance.  I went out on my patio to see what they were. I then saw four glowing somewhat egg shaped orbs move into a formation of two in a row over the other two and hover.   As I watched, another one began to rise from a little further west, and slowly move into the same area as the other four began to move away, in single file.  Several more followed suit, and there were probably at least ten of them in all. The objects made no noise, and the entire body of them glowed red orange.  The top of the orbs gave somewhat of a handle look over the lower part.  The tops were lighter in color and a little blurrier than the lower parts.  I could not see any flashing lights, or obvious external lights. The objects flew off in a slight \"S\" pattern, first coming from the west, then stopping and hovering, and then flying northwest, and finally north.  They appeared to be moving very slowly and gracefully, but in a matter of seconds, the lights became very tiny, seeming to have moved fast, though it didn't seem so.  Very odd. I lost sight of the objects when they just disappeared.  It was like a candle being blown out, not darting away or a sudden light going out.  They dimmed and went out.  The entire event was probably less than 5 minutes and I didn't have time to grab a camera.  Just before the last of the objects moved out of view, a small plane began heading in their direction. I could barely hear its engine.  The objects, however, made no sound.  The plane had blinking lights, whereas the objects appeared to be glowing, orb like things, with no external lights detectable.

{"text": "Spotted black hovering UFO of unusual/hard to distinguish shape near parking lot, before flying away at high speed. This sighting was very much a spontaneous encounter on my part, and ended almost as quickly as it began.  I was in my car, parked outside a strip mall next to a park, with a Taekwondo studio and Scuba Diving store in front of me.  I had just dropped off a family member, and was reading a book for college while waiting in the vehicle for my family member to return in about an hour.  A friend called me on my cell phone; I became distracted from reading, and so we talked for about five minutes before the beginning of the UFO encounter.   I was casually looking outside at my surroundings without much attentiveness, when I spotted this apparent craft.  I did not actually think it was an aircraft at all, at first.  I was looking up at the dark/grayish clouds in front of me, and I glanced in the craft\u2019s direction, thinking I had just seen a small dark break the clouds in my peripheral vision - as if I could see through to a darker cloud layer.  I was not at all alarmed, nor did I suspect it was a flying object.  I continued talking, and when I turned my attention to the area again maybe about 10 seconds later, I looked more closely, and noticed this was not a break in the clouds.  Something was definitely there, well below the cloud layer. I knew very quickly it wasn\u2019t a bird or plane, because it was hovering completely motionless in the air.  My immediate assumption was that this was a helicopter, which is perfectly reasonable, as I see them fly by from time to time, even at this particular parking lot.   I like to check out aircraft whenever I seen them, so I asked my friend to wait a moment while I sat up closer to my dashboard to focus in on the supposed helicopter.  I saw it was smaller than a helicopter; it had no tail, no propeller blades or moving parts, and made no audible sound.  It was unusually difficult to make out its shape.  This may have been because of its size and the dark backdrop.   But I stared at it for maybe about 20 seconds as it hovered there in the sky, absolutely motionless, expecting it to move.  I was so surprised at how still it was, I even moved my head left to right, just to be sure I wasn\u2019t somehow staring at a speck of dust on my windshield.  I am pretty sure it had corners; it was not an oval or sphere exactly, but it seemed like it was maybe rounded slightly.   I can\u2019t say for absolute certain, like I said earlier, the shape was hard to make out - but if I had to guess, it was perhaps a cube or triangle with rounded edges.  Very dark \u2013 basically black in color, and may have had a small gray or white marking on it, but I cannot say for certain as it could have been a reflection of the sky, if it was metallic.  But from my angle at least, I would describe it as fairly dull; a matte black. In terms of size, I would say it was one to two meters across, and one-half to one meter in height.   I was still on the phone, and began describing the object to my friend, who was listening closely, and became a little concerned for me.  I did not feel threatened by it, but was very curious nonetheless.  I sometimes keep a pair of binoculars in my glove compartment, and so I began quickly rummaging through papers, napkins, and tools I keep in there, while still keeping an eye on the object, only occasionally glancing into the glove compartment fo r a second or two.   I had two plausible explanations in my mind; it was either a big balloon of some kind, or a drone, but I wanted to find out for certain.   At the exact moment I thought that, it started to move slightly to the left, and then a second later bolted off at high speed, traveling backwards, away from me. It did not tilt, turn, or otherwise look like it had control surfaces or a propulsion system.  I became upset it was leaving, and I could not find my binoculars.  Still talking to my friend, I figured I took them out of the compartment a few months ago to bring on a boat trip, and forgot to return them.  The craft left the location pretty fast; in about 15 seconds, it was a tiny little dot, and disappeared somewhere behind buildings or trees.   I found it very unlikely to be a balloon because if it was, it probably would have been smaller and round, likely would have had a string or something attached to it, and would have been ascending at a constant rate, not to mention being bobbed and brushed by the wind - not sitting perfectly still in the air, before suddenly bursting off at a very high speed in basically one direction.   It is hard to guess how high and far it was from my location with only a limited number of items for a point of reference, but I would say no more than a quarter mile from where I was parked.  It was relatively low; my best guess, I would say between 6! 00 and 800 feet above the ground.   When it moved, it began gently, and increased speed very quickly.  I would approximate maybe 250 to 300 mph the last I saw it.  Also note, there was a young man, maybe about 25, sitting in his car parked next to me, but he was facing the opposite direction and was staring at his phone, so I did not bother to ask if he had also seen the craft after it had left.   As far as I could tell, we were the only two people in the parking lot capable of viewing the craft.   Once the surprise and adrenaline rush had worn down, I resumed my conversation with my friend, speculating what it could have been. I regretted not taking a picture with my phone, but on the other hand, it probably would have been too small to turn up as anything more than a few pixels on the image anyway.  I decided to take a picture at least of the sky conditions where the craft was, about five minutes after it left, to give some perspective as to how I saw it. The only plausible and conventional explanation I have was that it was a large, black, very fast moving drone, with long range wireless capabilities.  This is a suburban area, so it was hovering and passing over small buildings, houses, and some forested areas.  I have walked near the place where the craft was in the past, and I know there are some small fields and depressions in the ground, as well as a high school it most definitely would have passed over or near.  I do not know how long it was hovering there prior, but I know it sat still for at least the minute or two that I saw it from when I first glanced it in the sky.  For a craft that size and altitude, it should have had some light beacon to indicate its presence to other aircraft, and I would have expected it to be flatter with four or more distinguishable copter propellers if it was a drone.  This craft did not possess any of those features as far as I could tell, but I would be willing to accept a drone as a conventional answer.  I readily acknowledge that it is just an unidentified flying object.  I am not necessarily trying so suggest this was some event so extraordinary that it exceeds all conventional reasoning, nor that it is of extraterrestrial or otherwise supernatural origin.  It was certainly very odd though, and this is not the first instance in the time I have lived here that I have seen unusual or inexplicable aircraft. There was one other event that occurred on my thirteenth birthday when I was walking home from a store.  I was on the top of a hill nearing my neighborhood next to a forested area with only a couple sleepy houses to my right side, when I spotted a silvery metal craft, oval in shape flying over the forest, completely silent, and traveling at similar heights and speeds to this one. Unlike the case I am presenting here, I do have a picture of the actual craft itself (albeit a poor resolution one) taken from my phone, and posted on Facebook. In the original image, the craft was too small to see without zooming in, but it was nevertheless in the image.  I searched old data folders and even tried to revive the (now dead) phone I took the photo with to see if I could retrieve the original file, but unfortunately could not bring it back. In the Facebook photo of this somewhat similar craft, I enlarged the image of the craft and drew a red line indicating where it was in the image so t! hat people could view it more easily, but other than that, there was no editing or tampering concerning the image of the craft itself. Both that one and this one traveled in about the same direction, heading north-northwest. This was before drones (especially of that size) were commercially available as they are today. I have not made any case files on this previous sighting, and this is the first time I have reported a UFO, because I felt compelled enough to say this really was unusual enough to constitute a true UFO. After showing the first encounter to friends online, they did not believe me, thinking I had pocket lint on my camera, even though I assured them something was in the air. I dropped the topic, and rarely spoke of it again, but with this new sighting, it has made me think back on that experience. I am not suggesting there is any direct connection or correlation, but these events are similar in some ways, and this new encounter marks the second time I have seen! an unusual or unconventional aircraft in this area, seven yea! rs apart , in the same stretch of about 5 miles.

{"text": "Sitting on the front porch, at 4:35am, perfectly clear sky and still dark outside. We were looking at the sky and watching a plane/jet getting closer into view.  We spend many hours on our front porch watching planes, birds, etc.  We were waiting to see if this plane was going to make a turn towards Green airport or go over our house towards Logan airport. We see many planes (commercial flights, small planes, helicopters) day and night because it is a much used flight path and our view is perfect.  Most planes make a turn towards T.F. Green and a few go over our house and head towards Logan Airport. At that point there was a bright flash of light much closer to us than the plane we were watching.

{"text": "Green illuminated &quot;v&quot; shape seen above Montreal, Quebec, Canada Hello.  I would like to report an unusual sight in the skies above Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on the night of 22 July 2017. At approximately 10:15pm, three of us were on the 9th floor common roof-deck of a high-rise condo complex.  We were there to observe fireworks in the downtown area; these fireworks were, as it happened, low on the horizon and occluded by other buildings.  The sky was generally clear, with a few long & wide \u201ccontrail-like\u201d clouds present. After a few minutes of watching the skyline, etc., we looked directly overhead and saw the following phenomena.  We saw a grouping  of small white cloudlets within an elliptical patch of sky, whose long dimension was approximately equivalent to 5\u201d held at arm\u2019s length.  Within that grouping was an illuminated \u201cv\u201d shape, about \u00bd\u201d at arm\u2019s length in extent, with the arms of the \u201cv\u201d consisting of a number of bright \u201cpinpoint\u201d emerald green lights, each surrounded by small halos.  The shape and distribution of lights (which appeared quite definitely organized or \u201cnon-random\u201d to us) remained stationary, as far as we could tell. A we watched the \u201cv\u201d shape, we saw it gradually fade away.  Then, to one side of its location, but also within the elliptical patch of white cloudlets, we noticed a faint white line, extremely linear and precise, and stationary in the sky, with an extent of about 1\u201d at arm\u2019s length.  This white line, and the surrounding patch of cloudlets, then faded entirely from view; that is to say, it did not disperse or drift away. The duration of this sighting was approximately 45 seconds. At various times before and after the sighting, we noticed low light-aircraft above Montreal; in addition, a rotating searchlight/beacon was operating from one of the downtown highrises.  Regardless, the phenomenon we observed bore no relationship to these other light sources, nor to the distant fireworks.  And incidentally, we noticed that smoke from the low fireworks simply drifted with the wind, and did not fade out. Lastly, one of us (me) waited for clouds to drift into the area directly overhead, where we\u2019d seen the phenomena, to see if some local ground-based illumination might have been the culprit; but I saw nothing of the sort. For whatever it\u2019s worth, I myself am a PhD physicist (particle physics), 58 years of age.

(1967)  It was nice so we sat on the hood of my 1967 Mustang.  There were trees around the edge of the field and the city lights beyond that.  Suddenly we saw a disk like shape coming over the trees. Slow, no sound.  A Disk with a bubble top and 3 prongs below.   Then a strong light beam came from underneath and lit up the ground as it moved over the tree tops.  It went over near the WAMS Radio Tower and was gone.  Lights out.  No sound what so ever.   Moved very slowly at a paced speed.  My date was also in 10th grade at another school in the area.  I have not spoken with her in many years so I will not reveal her name at this time.  She saw everything that I saw.  We kind of froze at what we were seeing. I had powerful driving lights, actually my dad had small airplane landing lights, replacing the regular standard lighst, so I could have lit up the entire forest and UFO, but I was not sure that was such a good idea, so we just watched.

My languages are German, English, Hebrew and Macedonian.  Regarding the lights, I can definitely say that they were not Chinese lanterns, they were much too high or too far.  I know Chines lanterns, saw them many times in Germany. You must know that we are in the desert, surrounded by Bedouins, and of course military.  At this specific day there was no holiday, festival or whatever might give a reason for speculations of other kind. I understand that the photos are not clear and unambiguous.  The lights were drifting from the right to the left.  The peculiar thing is that the sighting left a deep impression on me, and believe me, I am a very down to earth person.  I read some of the reports you attached, and the similarity is quite remarkable.  Well, I won't dwell on this too much, I do want to thank you for your attention and your response.

It looked similar to a typical airplane at that distant, but the front 1/3 section seemed to be independent of the remaining 2/3 behind it. It was too far away to discern any sound from it.  It was too far away to discern any sound from it and the sky is always busy with airplane from nearby Logan airport. The object caught our attention due to its unusual shape and flight path.  We discussed it together while it flew above us.  Its flight pattern was toward Logan Airport, yet instead of descending toward Boston, it ascended up into the clouds above, until we could no longer view it.  The sighting lasted about 30 seconds.

{"text": "Unusually bright light moving across the sky. At appx 9:47pm CDT, I was outside on our east facing porch, just watching for satellites and meteors, as I like to do on weekend nights like the one that night:  no clouds and no moon.   I was scanning the sky, when I saw an exceptionally bright light in the SSW sky appx 40 degrees above the horizon.  This light was as much as a magnitude brighter than the planet Venus at that planet's brightest.  This light was moving to the NE and likely took 2-3 minutes to cross from the point of first sighting until it crossed the whole of the sky before disappearing behind some trees to my ENE.   I then moved to another part of the yard and was able to watch the light past the trees until it was lost to sight on the far ENE horizon.  I believe that it passed to the north of both Antares, and then Saturn, but to the east of Altair.  I don't believe that it got any higher than maybe 50 degrees above the horizon, maybe less.  The light was silent the entire time.  The light was solid the e! ntire time, neither blinking nor dimming.  I say it was solid to say that it did not blink or waver.  But it was so bright that it caused it to be more of a Venus-like glare, rather than a simple point of light.  It only dimmed as any light does as it moved farther away into the distance. In a single sentence it was as if Venus was moving across the sky. Over the years I have seen dozens if not hundreds of satellites.  I have seen many that seem to appear from nowhere and become very bright before quickly dimming to nothing.  In the moments just after spotting this light and seeing that it was not blinking (like an airplane) I assumed that it must be a satellite and expected it to very soon dim.  It never did to any extent.  I also felt that it was moving erratically, slowing then speeding up and wavering very slightly from side to side.  I say this because it was what I felt I was seeing.  I can NOT say that I am certain it was acting oddly.  Realizing that this was like nothing I had seen before I went to the door and asked my wife to come outside. She agreed that it was much brighter than what we had seen before. Without my prodding she said that it seemed to be moving in the same odd manner that I have described. Another point I want to make is that we live appx 7-8 miles NE of Tulsa International Airport and see many low flying aircraft near our home either just after takeoff or turning west toward a landing.   Just as my wife was coming to the door, I began hearing sounds of an airplane, and started to feel that was the explanation.  But when I looked up I saw the airplane lights moving from the S to N but beginning a turn to the west that would take it behind our house towards the airport flight lanes.  The bright light in question was already well to the east. When the plane was lost to sight the sound went away.  Again I did not hear any sound that I would associate with the passing light.   There is a National Guard Center about 5-6 miles to our south and they house a number of military helicopters.  I have seen them flying in the area many times.  Later, I considered that if this were a helicopter, for its lights to have been that bright, it would have to be flying rather low, and I would certainly have heard that familiar chop chop sound. My wife and I also considered the idea that it could have been a drone of some kind.  I don't know much about them but will say that other than the possible side to side waver I was feeling, this light traveled in a very straight line from one end of the flight to when it disappeared on the far horizon. To me this was an object that I could not identify with any certainty and since it was moving, flying in the sky it was a UFO.  I EXPECT that you will determine that it was indeed likely a satellite.  I expect that you have satellite information at your disposal and you will end this mystery quickly.

{"text": "Bright White Sphere Flying Above Street. Our two-story house sits on the north side of a street that goes east/west.  We are directly at the end of a T intersection.  Another street starts at this intersection and goes south. On June 15, 2017, at 19:30 (7:30pm), I was doing some planting in front of the house.  The sky was clear and the sun was nowhere in my line of vision.  Standing, I had turned and was facing a large flat window on the house, about 3.5\u2019 from me.  The window faces south.  Because of the thermal properties of the window, during daylight it is difficult to see anything inside, and everything outdoors is clearly reflected back.   I happened to be looking at the distinction of everything reflected and saw a bright white sphere, approximately 20\u201d in diameter, travel east to west about 35\u2019 directly above our street.  It was traveling about 41 mph, if my calculations are correct.  It did not waver up, down, or side-to-side.  It appeared to be following the street.  There was a slight visual softness about it that I consider to be an aura.  It produced no audible sound.   I turned around to face the street and search the sky to see if it might return.  I\u2019m still standing there one minute later (with the house to my back) when directly above me I see the sphere re-appear about 10\u2019 above my house, going north to south at the same speed as before and again, absolutely no audible sound.  This time, when it gets to where the edge of the street starts in front of the house, without hesitating it dips down about 5\u2019 and continues to fly straight south.  I noticed, instead of flying directly over the road like it did when it went from east to west, it flew about 15\u2019 to the west side of the north/south road and flew just above the tree tops.  There did not appear to be any comet\u2019s-type tail or other lights, only a complete bright white sphere.  I immediately recognized it as being the same type as I had encountered twice previously. This sphere is the same, if not identical, as what I saw and had hit my car while driving on the interstate on August 26, 2016, (3 miles away but also at the same time of day - please see that report) and also on October 22, 2016, (same location as now on the street that intersects with ours but during the night and that one flew south to north and further to the west off the intersecting street \u2013 was also witnessed by another person \u2013 please see that report). For more than 20 years, we often stargaze at night, watching stars and satellites.  These white spheres are unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen.

{"text": "At 10 PM, on July 3rd, 2017 my brother was walking by his kitchen sink when he noted an odd light in the sky from the kitchen window.  We walked out on the nearby porch and observed a burnt orange light to the north at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  It was a distinct orange light, with no discernible dimension to the naked eye, with a brightness comparable to the headlight of a commercial jet. We watched this light for several minutes from the kitchen porch, and observed during that time two successive white lights drop vertically downward from the orange light.  These white lights quickly faded out after their emission from the orange object, approximately 1 or 2 degrees below the object.  My impression was that the white lights moved faster than one would expect for freefall, while my brother thought the motion was consistent with freefall. Somewhat excited, we raced to the roof deck for a better view.  By the time we got there, a minute later, the object was no longer visible.  We looked in the location of the sky where it had last been seen, which was the constellation Cassiopeia, for a minute, or so.   Suddenly, a bright orange flash erupted near the middle star of the Cassiopeia constellation, that persisted for a split second.  As that occurred I thought I saw a faint streak of light angling upwards at 60 degrees to the left of the flash.  We observed nothing after that. When on the lower porch, earlier, we examined the object with 10 power binoculars, but it still was very small, seemingly pointlike.  My brother thought it had a round shape.

{"text": "Two fast moving green and silver orbs pass over Tulsa, Oklahoma. I am a 52-year-old researcher/data collection specialist.  I was sitting with my 78-year-old mother and 13 year old son on our back porch. I was looking to the southeast and two green glowing orbs appeared from behind a neighbor\u2019s roofline.  From my prospective, they appeared to be glowing green orbs with a barely noticeable silver edge around one edge of the green glowing circle; as if a sliver of the side of the object was observable.  The silver part seemed solid like it was metal. It is clear that they were several miles away.  They were also very high up.  It was a hot hazy day with hazy clouds high in the sky.  The objects were clearly observed being obscured by the clouds at times.  The two orbs stayed the same distance from each other throughout the observation.  They moved much quicker than an airplane but the movement was steady; not jerking around like perhaps a laser pointer might look. The orbs were heading towards us and the closer they got, the more obvious the details became.  It also was more obvious that the objects were very high up.  Once overhead, my perception was that they were not very big, maybe the size of a car.  At no time did we hear any sound coming from them. A middle aged couple was out for a walk and noticed my family looking at the sky.  They turned around and I asked them to look for the lights.  They saw them too.  We all stood and watched the lights move quickly but steadily towards us and over the house until we could not see them anymore.  My son said that right before they disappeared from our view, they circled each other.  This is the only observation that they broke the formation that we observed throughout.  My son is the only one who saw them circle each other.", "stats": "Occurred : 7/23/2017 20:05  (Entered as : 07/23/2017 20:05) Reported: 7/24/2017 9:53:05 AM 09:53 Posted: 7/27/2017 Location: Tulsa, OK Shape: Sphere Duration:7 minutes", "date_time": "7/23/17 20:05", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135335.html", "city": "Tulsa", "state": "OK", "shape": "Sphere", "duration": "7 minutes", "summary": "Two fast moving green and silver orbs pass over Tulsa, Oklahoma.", "posted": "7/27/17"}

I went to take photos of the milky way at the St. Croix River canoe landing in St. Croix, New Brunswick, at about 11pm (Atlantic time).   I set up my camera, and had taken a few shots at f3.5,  25 seconds, iso2500. I just happened to turn to the right and saw this very very bright object in the sky over head.  If I had to measure it with my fingers, I would say it was about 1 1/2 inch by 1/2inch. I am just guessing now as it happened so fast.  I have never seen anything that bright in the sky.  It was crescent shape with  a small extension in the middle of the back side. I tried to get my camera off of the tripod and change my settings, but could not see very well . I had a flashlight and tried to get it set, but the object was moving fast and it was almost gone.  I switched my camera to movie mode and took a couple of shots.  I couldn\u2019t tell were I was shooting as I couldn\u2019t see very well on my screen.  I had live view on, but my lens was at 18mm so everything looked small.

{"text": "An UFO generated intense orange light with sound, modulated those synchronously for 20 sec, while hanging above our house. Reporting an UFO sighting on July 24, 2017 around 3:00 am. On July 24, 2017, both my wife and I woke up around 2:30 am with loud thunders from lightning.  As we tried to sleep, we heard a few more thunders around the Drummond North area.   Then, suddenly, we heard a loud sound and the intensity of that sound was increasing and decreasing periodically with a time period of 2 or 3 seconds.  Our ears were able to detect that periodic nature of the sound.  Then a bright orange beam of light entered our room through a window.  The intensity of that orange light became brighter and darker in synchronization with ups and downs of the loudness of the sound.  As this event was unfolding, we both thought that lightning might have started fire at a power transformer somewhere.  So, I asked my wife to call 911, and I ran to the window. After removing the curtain of a window, I saw that a cylindrical structure hanging between our house and a neighbor\u2019s house at a height of about 40 to 50 feet above my window.  The approximate size of that cylindrical structure could be about 5 feet in height and 2 feet in diameter.  That structure was generating both the sound and the light beams, and their intensities were modulated synchronously.  The sound had the characteristics of running a huge blower whose speed was changing periodically in a very controlled manner.  The light was so intense that at its peak value that I was getting blinded by it.  Our backward was lighted up as if the sun\u2019s rays on a clear midday have become orange and pulsing. As I tried to look directly at that cylindrical surface, I could only see some window-like features on that structure when the light intensity was low.  The beam of light was practically coming from all over the structure.  Instead of calling 911, my wife was so puzzled by the event that she unknowingly ran to another window and witnessed that bewildering event. Suddenly, the whole thing stopped.  That cylindrical structure just disappeared in front of my eyes, and the world around us appeared to be the same as before.  Approximately, whole event took probably between 15 to 20 seconds to unfold. I realized later that while that event was progressing, not a single dog barked in our area. We do not have a dog, but all of our neighbors do, and their dogs will bark even if a moderately loud car enters our area at night. In the morning when I was looking up and tried to identify the area where I saw that cylindrical structure, I realized that there is no electrical or any other overhead line has gone through that area or close to that area.  The trees around that area have no burning sign, at all.

Something was a little different this time.  What I first thought were landing lights were not.  It was the glow of the craft itself that I saw.  I looked for flashing beacon lights on the wings but there were none.  In fact, I could now tell there were no wings.  It was a simple orb.  It was traveling east northeast.  It was headed in the direction of DIA. As I continued to watch, it made a gentle turn to the southeast.  That is when I realized it was silent.  I said to myself \"What am I watching?\"  As it moved away from me, I was completely convinced that this was not a plane.

{"text": "Perfect sphere almost translucent but with a slight cloud like color moving across sky Driving home through West Mifflin, PA, we were stopped at a light at the intersection of Route 885 and Lebanon Church Road.  It was a very cloudy evening, and the sun was going down, but it was still bright.  Our kids (ages 19 and 11) started yelling to look at the UFO moving through the clouds!  The entire sky was cloud covered, so my husband, my mother and I had trouble finding it.   At first I thought the kids were just messing with me because they know I believe in UFO\u2019s and no one else in the car did, so I didn\u2019t look.  However, the panic and excitement in their voices along with the frantic pointing made me think this might not be a joke.   Due to the amount of heavy cloud cover, I was still unable to see it.   They took the cell phone and made a clear live picture of it moving very quickly in a straight line.  I have to say, when we looked at it, you can clearly see a perfectly round sphere moving quickly through the clouds just as they said.  Other than its shape being a perfect sphere, the color was odd.  It was the same color as clouds but slightly lighter.  Not metallic, not white, almost translucent.   That along with the perfect round shape and the fast movement made it visible against the back drop of the darker blue cloud.  It could have easily gone unnoticed if you were not looking in its direction.  This was not an airplane.   My husband, the complete skeptic said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was, but I know it wasn\u2019t a plane.

{"text": "Multiple Flashing lights moving in the sky. On July 25th, 2017, at approximately 2:20am, I went out on our back deck to smoke a cigarette. I went to the far end of the deck which faces east.  As I looked toward the tree line I noticed a strange multicolored light.  I was intrigued by the light so I continued to look at it.  I soon realized that the light was moving erratically.  Unsure I continued to watch. It began to move well above the tree line still moving up, down, side to side, and even in circular motions. I was awe struck, and knew no one would believe what I was seeing, so I went and woke my niece.  She witnessed the object, but went back to bed.  I was too captivated to stop watching. Not long after I seen the first object, I noticed that there was another moving light in the sky.  Both moving in the same manner with the same red, green, and white flashing lights.  Before long I had spotted five of these objects.  None of which could have been of natural occurrence. Around 4:18am one of these strange lights appeared just  on the other side of the tree line.  This one seemed very close.  It's light was a steady white, and it's movement was the same as the other objects.  It appeared so close that I went inside and grabbed a flashlight.  I could be mistaken, but it seemed as though the light would respond to the blinking of the flash light. At one point I counted as many as 11 of these lights, two of which seemed to inspect passing airplanes by approaching them closely. Something else that was strange during this event was that I witnessed what I believe to have been a total of nine meteors, but given what I witnessed and the way these lights would appear, I am unsure if they were meteors, or the objects joining the others. I am certain that someone else had to see the near, low flying, object I mentioned, because it hoovered above a state highway just behind our home.  It was too low, bright, and moving in such a manner to be mistaken for a star, and I could hear morning work traffic on the highway. This is true and accurate as I can tell it.

{"text": "Dark, spherical object 50 ft. above tree line silhouetted against evening sky in residential neighborhood. I was on an evening walk not far from my house, when I turned in a westerly direction on a residential street.  The time was around 21:00 hours EDT on the date of 7/08/2017.  As I walked generally towards the west, I saw a dark, round object silhouetted against the still bright western sky.  It appeared to be about 50 feet above the tree line at a heading of WNW from my location. It was motionless and emitted no lights or sound.  It also appeared to be slightly wider than it was tall but was generally spherical in shape.  It seemed to be about the size of one of my fingernails, held at arm\u2019s length, from my perspective. The first thought that came to mind was that I was observing a large tethered balloon some unknown distance away.  I also considered a kite but quickly dismissed that idea as there was barely a breeze and certainly not enough wind to keep a kite aloft.  I continued to walk westerly as I observed the object for about 10-20 seconds before the tree line obscured my view.  In that time, the object did not appear to move at all, but remained completely stationary.  I continued to walk to the end of the street and turned northerly at an intersection.  As I walked farther I tried to again observe the object through breaks in the tree line towards the west but to no avail.  The object was now gone. This is the first time in my life I have ever seen an object in the sky that I could not identify.  It did not appear to be a helicopter, plane or drone and (to reiterate) was completely silent.

{"text": "Extremely bright light hanging motionless 1000 ft up. As I was on my way to the store, driving on my back road, about half mile from my house, I was stunned to see a huge yellowish white gleaming light hanging in the sky about 800 to 100 feet up.  I said to myself, 'what the hell is that?'   I continued slowly driving, trying to see if the light/object moved at all, but it did not.  No sound was heard and no other smaller lights were visible on the 'craft.'  It reminded my of the usual artist conception of the star of Bethlehem, as depicted on Christmas cards.   I lost sight of it behind the trees on my left, as I drove on.  I wanted to get to a large farm up the road that offered a clear view of the sky.  When I got there, about 3 minutes later, I could see no light at all anywhere.  Way off, I could see a stationary light in the sky, but it could have been light from a plane.   Driving back from the store, I continued to scan the night sky, which was mostly clear with stars and a moon just starting to rise.  More than a f! ew cars were out as it was a nice night and lots of tourists in this part of southern Rhode Island are out and about.  So, someone else had to see this.  Whether the light/craft moved on or just disappeared, I don't know.  I will continue scanning the sky tonight to see if anything comes back.  This area where I live (Perryville section of South Kingstown) continues to be a 'hot spot' for UFOs.

They sounded like they could be fire planes and since we live in an area of extreme fire danger we are always on the alert for fire activity this time of year.   When I looked up and saw the first plane and it was moving to the south, at that time, I noticed a bright shiny object that looked like it could be in the path of the plane.  When the plane passed behind the object, I realized the object was closer to me.  That's when I noticed it wasn't moving at all, just stationary and not moving.   I was trying to process what this was that I was seeing, another plane, helicopter, weather balloon etc.  But I am sure what I was seeing was not any of those!

{"text": "Two star-like objects preceding and following one larger tumbling or spinning object, similar in size to airliner We always sit on our back deck and watch the skies for aircraft but this night was different. It was not yet dusk, skies were clear with no cloud cover.  I saw what I thought was an airplane but something didn\u2019t look right. It was either spinning or tumbling as it was moving.  As soon as I saw this I said to my wife, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look good-something is wrong,\u201d thinking it was a plane in trouble and going to crash.  But the object kept on moving in the same trajectory, not losing altitude. That\u2019s when it got weird because as I was watching, two star-like objects appeared around the larger object. While what I saw was in the distance-like an airliner at high cruising altitude- this larger object was as large if not larger in size than a jet plane.  The two smaller objects were like moving or shooting stars only they maintained a consistent altitude, never falling.  They did at times pull closer to the main larger object. The objects came from south of us and travelled north east until they reached a position pretty much in front of us.  It is a guess that the objects were approximately 50 degrees above the plane of the ground.  At that time they appeared to stop in midair, but in hindsight we think they may have changed direction heading east away from us until they disappeared from sight--smaller objects first, then the largest was last to fade away.  This all happened fast and they travelled at a speed similar to that of an airliner. We live within 15 miles of Bradley Airport and watch planes on approach all the time.  But this was different because these objects travelled away from the airport\u2019s location.  What we found odd was that all during the time we watched, there were no other visible aircraft.  Once the objects disappeared, air traffic seemed to resume--at least eight other planes came into view within the next five minutes.

{"text": "Black tubular object at 11AM with helicopters. On Monday, July 10, about 11AM ET, my wife and I were driving on I-76 Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound, MM 225 near Newville, PA.  The sky is clear and sunny, visibilty is very good.  I am in the drivers seat.  Our speed, and other traffic, is 80 mph.  Earlier I had seen a sign \"Speed Monitored By Aerial Surveillence,\" so I was watching.   To the southwest, my left, through the front windshield, I saw a helicopter.  It was a white, familiar-looking police helicopter, hovering at an altitude that appeared normal for police traffic helicopters, and less than a 1/4 mile south off the Interstate.  Mountains rise up about 10 miles ahead, and I could see a small white airplane in the distance, banking to my left.  I looked at the helicopter, and noticed a long straight black tubular object (1) (the top surface reflecting the sun) above it, at approximately twice the altitude of the helicopter.  I comment to my wife, \"What do you think that is?\"   My first thought was a large solar balloon.  The tubular object appeared to be more than twice as long as the helicopter and about the same diameter as the cabin of the helicopter.  The black tubular object was not a rigid cylinder and would fold to form a V shape, both arms about the same length.  At one point, I saw (2) one of the arms fold again about 1/4 of the length from the end.  By now, I am looking directly out of the drivers side window, due south.   A second white helicopter has appeared, and both helicopters maintain their altitude beneath the object.  The three aircraft do not appear to be moving away, but hovering.  The white airplane that I saw earlier, is now in view, south of the Interstate and at some distance beyond the helicopters and appears flying a circular path around the object, as I can see some top surface of the wings.  Moving past the event, I see the tubular object straighten out briefly and then refold (3) into a V.  It's still south of the Interstate, behind us and then lost to my view.  I was in the passenger's seat.   When my husband called my attention to the object, it was south of us, and I looked out of the driver's side window (I had already noticed one helicopter), I first thought it was a small flock of birds flying closely together.  When I realized it wasn't birds, I paid more attention.  It looked like (4) a translucent object floating without form, sort of like a jellyfish, but it had some kind of black large pieces to it that I took to be the birds originally.  I thought perhaps it was a large clear weather balloon that was descending.  I was not able to see it for very long, being on the opposite side of the car.

{"text": "UFO scares cows and starts stampede breaking electric fence My friend and I were returning home one evening, after fishing about 7-8pm.  It was clear with no wind or noises.  We were taking the back roads home in the country.  As I was driving my friend said look at that.  We both saw this object very slowly descending down.  It looked like something close to being spherical shape with white lights revolving around it.  We were about 1/4 mile away.  There was absolutely no noise which was extremely odd.  I turned down the next country and watched this object slowly go down behind a house with hills behind it.  As we got to the house where this went down, there were cows running all over the road, frightened and mooing.  They had broke through an electric fence that was popping on the ground.   We stopped to try and get the cows off the road, when a neighbor, whom I knew, came down to help.  He asked if we knew what had happened because cows just don't break down an electric fence for nothing.  We didn't say anything about what we had just seen. No one was home at the house when this happened.  I've often thought about going back there but that was 40 years ago.  My friend and I still talk about it.  It was real.

One, the first, was so similar to the 6/9/17 Boulder, CO, report, that I have been moved to recount it here. In my original report, I described two types of orbs, one brilliant white that appeared as a metallic disc upon arcing miles away in a second or two, then pausing before disappearing straight away.  Another orb, deep reddish orange, smooth-surfaced, glowing darkly, appeared at the end of the event.  I now am thinking it may well have been the same craft!   After the initial sighting, with the object having arced away from a standstill corresponding to my fearful reaction, and while I was feeling bad for having only seen it so briefly, I think it came back, only this time it was moving slowly beneath the clouds erratically shining a beam up into the clouds along with a red pulsing light, still overwhelmingly brilliant white orb of light otherwise.  It disappeared into the clouds. Some moments later the reddish orange dark glowing orb appeared just hovering up in a pocket under cloudy outcropping  directly above me until the clouds enveloped it.

{"text": "Low silent object with multiple blinking lights followed by bright light over field \tLast night, at around 10:15PM, my boyfriend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette. We were sitting in a golf cart on the driveway talking.  He looked over at me, and saw lights behind my head that weren\u2019t like normal plane lights.  When he pointed it out, I turned and looked. What I saw next is hard to explain. \tThe object that was moving in the sky was very large, and no more than 500 feet in the air, and it was silent.  A normal plane, at that height, would have been so loud.  We were in an open driveway, in a middle of a field, so the night was quiet.  We would have heard it if it was a normal plane. This object was so low, and moving slowly.  When we noticed planes in the sky later, they seemed to be moving so fast compared to how slowly this object had been moving. \tThe lights themselves were so different from anything I\u2019ve ever seen before.  The object looked like a triangle shape, but the sky was dark as I\u2019m assuming the object was as well. But on each side, in the  middle, there were blinking lights.  They were blinking both red and white.  We watched as this object turned, and as it changed direction I saw more lights.  Either on the bottom or top of the object there was also a circular pattern of lights, that seemed to be rotating.  There were at least 10 lights all together, if not more. \tWe watched for about 5 minutes as this object made its way overhead before disappearing above the tree line.  My boyfriend and I were talking, and I was trying to reason with him logically.  We\u2019re in Carlisle, PA.  There are plenty of military bases around.  Carlisle is a huge shipping port. Etc, etc.  Then we stood up to go inside.  As we got out of the golf cart and turned to enter the house, we saw a light so bright just hovering then, above the field. \tAt this point, I almost couldn\u2019t move.  This light also was maybe 500 feet in the air.  It hovered in one spot, but not completely still.  It seemed to almost dance in the sky.  It was only one light I could see. But it was so bright, it had beams coming off of it, almost like it looked like a pinwheel.  It was so bright, it made everything else feel dark.  I couldn\u2019t even see the tree line in the distance.  It didn\u2019t fly away, it didn\u2019t do anything. \tThat is when my boyfriend grabbed my arm and pulled me in the house.  He was scared and wanted to go inside, but I couldn\u2019t look away.  This experience lasted only maybe 2 minutes in its entirety before I made it into the house.  But once I got inside I realized more.  This light was also silent, and for how close and bright it was, it would have had to have been making a noise.  Even small drones you can hear in the air.  But this was completely silent. \tWe went to tell his brother and friends, and when we told them it had just had happened, they ran outside to see if it was still there.  Within 5 minutes, by the time we had made it back outside, this light was gone and there were no traces of it.  When we walked back outside, the sky was brighter and back to normal.  It seemed almost like a different atmosphere outside. \tThis also, is happening at a time when a lot of strange things have been happening to me.  I have RH- blood, and joke about being an alien pretty frequently.  But, I\u2019ve recently been waking up with strange bruises that are very small (less than half an inch) in diameter, and are in a straight line.

Was expecting that it might be a helicopter or aircraft, but no familiar sound accompanied the lights.   I then dashed inside the house, grabbed my IPad and went back outside to take photographs. By the time I returned (15 seconds later), the lights were now higher in the sky, still eastbound and moving away much faster.  I tried to zoom in the focus.  The image stabilizer box on the IPad focused on the lights.  I took two images, but as I said, by now the object was higher and moving away quickly. When I reviewed the two photos, they did not appear to show much of any useful image. My guess would be some military aircraft, but really don't know.

{"text": "formation or fleet of UFOs, orange/red oval shape. On July 4th 2011, at approximately 21:30pm, there were firewalls towards the east of my home (Pembroke Pines).  My neighbors were also doing some firewalls, and I went out my home to  watch them while walking my dog.  Then I saw a formation of six (6) bright incandescent red/orange oval objects in the sky, to the east, traveling from north to south.  The distance between each object was exactly the same, and there was not a noise from them.  The traveling speed was constant.  So, initially I thought a kind of balloons, perhaps attached between them, however I disregarded that explanation because of the constant speed, no noise, and the size of each object (bigger than a commercial airplane).  I see frequently lot of planes due to the location of the two airports (MIA and FLL), and these objects were not airplanes.  My neighbors saw them also, and they described them as something \u201cbizarre\u201d.  I follow the object with my eyes all the way, until the horizon did not allo! w me to watch them anymore.  However, after the six-object passed all the way in front of my sight, one minute after, another object, same shape and color started flying in the same spot the six other started minutes before, and this one follow the same path of the others, at a much more speed than the previous ones.

She was half asleep and not to happy with my drilling her and so she wasn't paying me much attention.  Out of the corner of my eye something caught my attention.  It was a light in the field behind the barn, it looked just like the house lights that I see every night in the distance but for some reason I felt I needed to go look at this one more closely.  It was real dark, it must have been cloudy cause I didn't see a star or the moon anywhere.   I walk behind the barn and kneel down and stare at the \"house light\". Nothing happens for a few minutes than it starts to move real slow, it's moving towards me.  I blink my eyes a few times to make sure they aren't playing tricks on me.  Nope,  it's getting brighter and closer.  That's when I pull out my cell phone and fumble ! around trying to find the right app. I'm looking at the light moving closer to me and back down at my phone.  I'm freaking out a little bit at this point but I manage to get a video app downloaded and open and start filming what I am seeing but still not sure believing event.  I point my phone And hit record.  Not 1 minute after I start recording this slow moving light it starts to go the other way, away from me.  As I continue to record this object gets more intense in hits movements and at one point a large light goes off, like in a rectangle shape proximity above me and this object.

{"text": "The objects do change from one type to another.  They appear every night; rectangular, round, long stream of lights. This is a summary of what my husband and I have witnessed and observed on our home security camera system since March 17, 2017, when we first observed a strange rectangular string of very bright lights, attached to what appeared to be a metal bar, in the southwest corner of the backyard, picked by the video on camera #7.  The string of lights appeared to be an ordinary light one would have in a shop; however, it is only visible on screen of the video recorder.  When we look outside, the lights cannot be seen with the naked eye. This summary does not address a single sighting, but is current and on-going almost nightly since April 8, 2017, when we first began to monitor and document observations of the nighttime activities, taking place around the property on a regular basis and have replayed and captured quite a few pictures and videos, documenting what we have observed today to date. Since we first began to observe closely on April 8, 2017, it has gone to another level in terms of the entire operation.  It appears that it has become an invasion of our property, now we are seeing strange creatures that cannot be described as humans as we know them.  They are very small in stature, fly in appearing as birds, brightly lit all over, and changing into circles and into small creatures with human characteristics in terms of movement, but definitely not human. When they come in they appear to be carrying out what appear to be specific  pre assigned tasks, prior to the larger equipment, consisting of very long strings of lights that appear to be controlled by something or someone to turn on and off periodically, as they approach the property.  Initially, they were coming from the trees on the west and the north sides of the house, only. Now they are coming from the southwest most of the time, and the West and North some of the time. There appears to be space ship! s and/or aircraft type objects characteristic of but different, i.e. Smaller, but able to light up a large area when they appear.  (Modes of travel) involved in the operations.  Sometimes the forerunners come in as a large brightly lighted circle or rectangular object.  From what we have observed, they come in as workers, here to do a job. They appear to be well coordinated and work in conjunction with the other objects as they come in.  As a part of the preparation, they appear to spray an unknown substance that look like snowflakes and appear to turn into hale or sleet resembling crystal flakes.  When they are in the completely screened pool area they release some type of substance into the water before the others come in.  Sometimes when it rains, we see many of something dive into the pool, which is completely enclosed, with no opening, except the locked doors. They have attempted to remove the small Weber grill from the pool area unsuccessfully. It is difficult to explain what we are personally seeing because it is monumental.  I must mention an incident that happened on May 6, 2017, at approximately 11:30PM when a laptop computer vanished from the reception room, while we were removing items from the car, which was parked right in from of the door.  The laptop was placed on a credenza inside of the reception area; it disappeared and has not been seen since. On the morning of May 29, 2017, at 5:39AM, we were seeing family off who were taking a trip in their automobile; we were in the driveway assisting them in re-arranging some of the articles in the car to make more room.  While we were outside, we did not hear or see anything or anyone, However, on replay of the video, The unidentified objects were flying all over our heads the whole time we were outside, approximately 30 minutes. I have looked for every possible logical explanation to understand what is going on.  Have researched the internet on aliens, demons, religion, witchcraft, national security, etc.   All I can explain is that the activities are very organized, comparable to an army, and there appears to be what I have determined to be the captain or director, who is always present.  Some time they appear to conduct air shows, with precision and formation. There are concerns about water and earth contamination as well as other concern.  We are looking for answers.

Turning to face the flash, I observed a sphere, of unknown size, moving from West to East slowly across the sky.   The sphere moved in a straight line slowly, taking approximately 3 minutes to move 45 degrees in the arc of the sky. The sky was clear of clouds and there was no significant wind during this part of the morning, any wind which was moving was passing from South-East to North-West at somewhere less than 10 miles an hour. The only object which was in the sky at the time of the event which could be used as reference was the moon.  The object observed, appeared to be 1/16 of the diameter of the visible moon at the time with best estimate. The object appeared to be a metallic red color as it would catch sunlight and \u201cflash\u201d very brightly a red color.  This flash is what caught my attention in the first place.

{"text": "Daylight object in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport I was operating a sound system (mics and speakers) for the groundbreaking of a new Valley Metro light rail station at 50th St. and Washington in Phoenix, serving the Ability 360 Center.  This location is almost exactly one mile from the eastern end of the north runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, runway 26.  The event was taking place on the roof of the three story facility.  There is a shade structure running along the north and west portions of the roof.  A 20'x20' canopy had been erected to provide shade for the guests.  My position was near the northeast corner of the roof where I had a small audio mixing board set up.  At that time aircraft were departing Sky Harbor to the east, from the north runway, passing less than a half-mile from my position. \tThe event had begun at 8am with the Phoenix Mayor discussing details of the project.  At 8:20am, I noticed an object come into my field of view from the north, just above the Mayor's position at the podium, at a bearing of about 310 degrees.  It was elongated in the horizontal direction, reflective or very light in color.  I could not judge distance, but felt that it might be about a mile away, based on having witnessed countless aircraft approaching Sky Harbor.  I appeared to be similar in size to a small FedEx single engine turboprop aircraft which utilize Sky Harbor.  Its altitude was lower than that of an aircraft crossing over, so I immediately assumed it was making an approach, but it should have been much further west if that were the case.  I could not detect any vertical structure such as a tail, the reflective brilliance made it difficult to make out details. \tIt continued south for a short distance then suddenly either came to a complete stop or made an immediate \u201cjog\u201d toward the west.  At this point the idea of \u201cdrone\u201d popped into my mind, but the apparent distance to the object made it questionable if a drone would be that visible.  The other reason to reject the drone theory was the proximity to Sky Harbor.  The object then continued making a fairly rapid arc toward the southeast, again with an immediate acceleration which seemed very \u201cdrone like.\u201d  I lost sight of it behind the canopy until it emerged southwest of my position.  It appeared to be following the departure path of  runway 25, the center runway, toward the east, but more rapidly than a traditional aircraft. I continued to observe it for another 10 seconds until it moved behind a large structure on the roof.  I moved to the other side of the structure but I did not see the object again. \tI could not detect any noise from the object, at least nothing which I could hear above the traffic on Washington Street and the PA system I was operating.  The movement was unlike normal aircraft in the sudden acceleration and deceleration.  The object's altitude seemed constant. \tBased on the flight path I observed I would dismiss any thought of it being an actual drone.

{"text": "Cross- shaped lighted UFO south of Cimarron, CO. The object caught my eye on the western skyline, as it slowly gained altitude and began to move towards me.  The object moved silently and slowly from the west towards the full moon in a flight path directly over my campsite.  I estimated the object altitude to be approximately 2000-4000 feet above my head as it passed above me.   A commercial jet entered my field of vision to the northeast of the object, flying west.  The jets were easily heard and the flasing lights were clearly visible on the commercial airplane, even at the much higher altitude.  In contrast the UFO made no noise and the lights were constant. As the object passed above me I saw two large rectangular light panels, one to the front and one behind with a smaller square panel on each side at the center point.   The lights were very bright as it went overhead and the moonlight was also bright, but i could not see any shape or outline, only the cross shaped light panels.  The object moved towards the fu! ll moon and seemed to gain speed as it became smaller and disappeared, last seen moving towards the moon in a shallow ascent.   A few things about this sighting that i really can not explain or understand are: - the object did not move in a conventional manner when the object transitioned from a vertical ascent to an eastern flight path, the path was noticeable angular the movement was very slow at first, then gone - the object made no noise at all - the four light panels were all white in color - the objects lights were constant, none flashed - the only thing visible on the object were the light panels, no outline or shape I am positive that I witnessed technology from another world.

I happen to be beside three guys work near a moving van and asked them to look up at the strange black thing in the sky.  They all stared with me for 30 seconds and I asked what they thought it was.  One guy said, \"It's probably a drone..  Or probably not \"with a puzzled look.  The other two said they thought it was strange.  I said its maybe a kite and continued walking to the corner, but kept watching the object. As I came to the corner, a tree blocked my view, but as I was able to see it again past the tree, I was shocked to see that it had projected itself in the trajectory of my eyesight and itself approximately 50-100 miles away and on a 45 degree angle that went straight towards space. I tried to grab my camera but didn't want to take my eye off it, and within 5 seconds, it was so tiny that it disappeared into the sky at a steady, but rapid speed.  I went back to the truck and asked the three guys if they had continued watching it after I left and they said no. I speculated it was like the object sensed it was noticed by me and took off when the guys stopped looking and when my vision was blocked by the tree I had passed. I am a average working man and haven't seen anything my whole life except for now two sightings ( including this one) in the last two years and I just turned 40.  Strange thing is I had just left my friends house after telling him a theory about how we as humans are the top predators and think zombies are scary, but if we had a new predator, an alien one, that we would find whatever shape the alien was to be horrifying and our instincts would change to fear the sight of them and that we would become uncivilized and not be able to be in groups, as we would be easily targeted by this new predator that we don't even know exsists yet.  For some reason I think such a horrible race of \"monsters\" exsists in space just waiting forsure numbers to get to a certain point like they have for generations.  Waiting till the earth is full of humans than coming down and harvesting us all spare a few to re- colonize.  Just a theory, but a mortifying one one is reluctant to ponder on.

I laid flat on the grass and had amber driving glasses on, in addition to my myopia lenses.  I was looking straight up to the zenith, watching airplanes from LGA airport, etc..  The sun was almost but not quite overhead, and shaded by a leafy branch, so I was able to gaze into the blue without the sun against me.  The clouds were minimal and there was a slight haze and I had a little coffee to drink and was relaxing.   Slowly, but suddenly, like a ghost appearing, there was a distant craft proceeding westward and slightly northward at an angle, slowly creeping.  It had a distinct boxy appearance almost like it had \"solar panels\" on both sides, and there was a faint blinking sidelight hard to make out because of the bright conditions.  It was at the limits of my visual acuity to make out any detail, but it was optical in nature as I was able to play with the image using my fingers in a triangle pinhole lens and saw it refract.   Soon after this, to my right (north), a group of approximately 5 (or more) of the same \"craft\" appeared in a rough and slowly jiggling polygon along with an extra slightly off to one side (\"apple\").  This cluster slowly appeared out of nothing, and they too had faint blinking lights.  There was no entry direction, and were ghostly in appearing.  It stayed like this for about 2 minutes and then as if on cue, all of them slowly faded back into nothingness without any abrupt motions.  The lone craft from the beginning was proceeding in its same linear direction and still visible, and then that, too, slowly disappeared in a ghostly fashion.   At the end of this, I checked the sky without the amber lenses and saw that the area where there was the cluster of the craft was blue without clouds and only some haze as it was a hot day.   The lone craft was in an area of very thin cloud.  They did not act like drones and there were too many of them, and they just appeared and disappeared.  They did not get bigger or smaller; there was no noise and they all looked the same.

{"text": "Witnessed a red pulsing light and what we thought was a white star. This incident occurred in Chula Vista, CA, between 5:00pm and 5:36 pm.  My Daughter and I are in town to assist my Mom after a surgery last week.  My Mom\u2019s Neighbor invited my Daughter and me to take advantage of their swimming pool while she and her Family went out of town to go camping.  So we decided to do just that.  In her yard she has a lounge and as my Daughter and Niece were enjoying the pool I decided to lay on the lounge to relax.  As I was laying in the lounge I noticed a plane flying really high in the sky.  My Mom regularly has planes fly fairly low while waiting to land at Lindbergh Field.  This plane was definitely cruising much faster and much higher than other planes. This was when I noticed a faint white star in the North Eastern sky as I was lying facing North. It was clearly above the plane that flew by.  The star was faint enough to lose the image of the star in the ocean of blue sky in So. Cal if I looked away.  I used a palm tree to pinpoint the faint white star and kept staring at the star because it seemed to elongate then turn into a pinpoint, but I figured it was because I was literally staring at this star in the sky and my eyes were playing tricks on me. I decided to open up my star app on my phone, my Daughter and I love to use it up where we live in Auburn, CA.  The star app showed the tail end of ursa major or ursa minor I don\u2019t quite remember which constellation.  In addition I am not sure if the app was calibrated properly.  Another plane flew by, again high in the sky, but not in the path of the star, which I thought was strange because I first saw the star because of the flight path of the first plane.  Then I considered the current plane is probably flying from a different airport to a different location hence the different location of the star in the sky. I continued to stare at this star when all of a sudden a red round light appeared right next to the star. Appeared is not the correct explanation it faded into view.  This red light pulsed and faded into itself.  The size of the round red light was smaller than the size of a round sewing pin when it was wide open and it disappeared when the pulse collapsed in on itself. I sat and stared at this pulsing light that was way above the next plane that flew by.  It circled around the white star all the while pulsing. At that time I thought I was seeing things.  No way could a red pulsing light be so high up in the sky circling around what I thought was a star.  So I called my 11 year old over and asked her to lay with me.  We use specific words to pinpoint stars in the night sky regularly so I directed her to the faint star in the sky.  She said, \u201cOh my god Mom!  I\u2019ve never seen a star in the daytime before.  Is that a planet?\u201d  Then she said in a concerned tone.  \u201cMom, what is that?\u201d  I asked her to describe what she saw.  She said, \u201cWhat is that pulsing light? Mom? What is that light circling the star?\u201d  She had a little fear in her voice.  I said to her I was not sure what we both were seeing and that I\u2019m glad she saw it too.  We both laid there and watched this pulsing light slowly move around the star one last time and then it moved east.  A tiny little pulsing red light expanding and collapsing in upon itself about 12\u201d to 16\u201d in the sky and then poof.  It was gone. I continued to watch that star for an additional couple of minutes and then I realized.  The faint star had moved North East in the sky about 6\u201d toward the palm tree.  After thinking about this incident for the last couple of days I realized that stars move from East to West in the sky and that star moved East so slowly that I didn\u2019t realize it until after I stopped looking at the star and took one last glance up.  What I saw was not natural.  It was not a meteor. It was not a plane.

I noticed that it looked different from an aircraft (we live south of St. Louis airport so airplanes are common and frequent) and had an orange/red glow much like a flame so my first guess was that it could be a hot air balloon.

It seemed to speed up and soon was beyond the trees on our horizon to the north.   The entire siting lasted approximately 10 minutes.

{"text": "Solid green light spotted dancing in the sky. While letting my dog outside, I noticed a green light hovering in the sky to the southwest.  I watched it for a minute, wondering if maybe it was a plane.  But it just stayed in the same spot, so it couldn't have been a plane.  Plus the light was solid and not blinking.   After a minute I realized I left my phone in the house.  So, I ran inside and grabbed it and started to record footage.  Keep in mind, it's night outside and I'm using a phone for video.  It was hard to keep it steady due to the zoom level that I used on top of it being on the completely black background of the sky.   It was making strange sideways and up and down motions, which is hard to tell on the video due to a lack of reference.  I watched it for another 2 minutes then went inside to grab a witness.  By the time we got back outside it was gone.  I also realize for some reason the phone did not capture the green of it that I saw.  The green that I saw was as green as a green traffic light.  I would estimate its height at around 6000 feet and around 5-6 miles from me.  The blinking in the video was when it would go behind a power line.

At 10:30 pm this evening I went outside in my back yard to secure the patio furniture for incoming storms that were predicted.  The rear of my house faces due north.  I looked up into the sky and saw lightning far off in the distance towards the north.   I then noticed two red balls of light traveling from the west  (approximately along the path of I-70) moving to the east at a fairly rapid speed. At first I thought it might be a helicopter, or two.  As they came closer, I heard no sound from any type of engine.  Two lights travelling the same distance apart in the same path.  Red orange in color, not blinking, but solid the entire time. As they came from the west, about the time they were directly behind my home, the lead light turned due north and appeared to gain altitude, fading from view, possibly behind clouds.  The second light followed the exact same path as the first one, and also disappeared. About two to three minutes later, from the south west of my home, and closer to my home, I saw three additional lights, the exact same appearance as the first two.  The first two were closer together, with the third one trailing a bit behind.   I called my wife out to see what I was seeing, and to bring her cell phone to take pictures.  She arrived, and confirmed that she was seeing what I was seeing.  She tried to take pictures, but they did not turn out very well. Again, the three objects followed the same path of the first two, and turned due north, fading away from my view.   No sound of any engine was ever heard, no other color of light was ever seen other than the red/orange solid light color. At first I thought it might be a Japanese lantern display of some kind, but the objects were moving too fast, and the winds were from the northeast, the opposite direction that the objects were moving.  The two separate groups maintained a distinct separation distance from each other, and equal speed.  Hot air Japanese lanterns would not behave this way. Aircraft routinely fly over our home as they move into the landing pattern for St. Louis Int. Airport Lambert Field.   I know what an aircraft looks and sounds like, and how it behaves.  I do not believe these objects to have been aircraft. I am not a believer in aliens, or UFO\u2019s.

An almond- (or oval-) shaped UFO in the sky in Panama City, Panama, was observed in a direction where no such object was observed for a whole two years prior to June 18, 2017.  Proximity to building provided reference point that the craft was static.  The object generated its own energy source as it was brightly lit.  (It recalled a previous sighting in early childhood in South America observed by the entire neighborhood which also featured an object that was similarly lit.   That object sat up in the sky but slightly higher than the horizon).  This craft was located much higher up, possibly in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere.  But it was far closer than a satellite would have been and, again, it did not move.  Stars that evening were also clearly seen and looked like distant dots.   Object also appeared to have a rod-like shaft of light sticking downward out of its belly.  It is not possible to tell whether it was a light beam or a solid part of the craft.  The general impression was similar to that of a wasp in flight \u2014 except that the object did not move.  Because the craft\u2019s shape was elongated, it could have well been a transport vehicle.  But it was too far up in the sky to make out any occupants.  It also looked rather large.

Out of no where what I thought was a plane coming in suddenly appeared.  As I continued to view the unidentified object for the next few seconds, it came to a sudden halt.  Meaning the object just STOPPED and seemed to rest at a 35 degree angle, meaning the lights were in a straight line at around 35 degrees.  I knew at that time it wasn't a plane. I immediately yelled to my wife to come and look.  She came outside and saw exactly what I saw.  The 2 colors (green and red) were very bright.  I then told her to get my phone and of course by the time she got back and I turned it on and started recording, it was gone but that isn't the end of what I witnessed. A couple of caveats to point out. 1.  This object \"just appeared.\"  My chair where I was sitting just happened to be pointing in that direction, so I was basically looking at the area in the sky and it just appeared where as if it where a plane, it would have been seen coming from the left. 2.  When the object disappeared, it didn't just disappeard, it was moving father and father away and then we could no longer see the lights. 3.  No noise.  No sound  4.  The object was up in the sky quite a bit.  About 15 minutes later, an actual plane was taking off, and was about 70% lower than the object, really just right above the horizon. About 30 minutes later directly overhead we seen what seemed to be the same object except for this time it was extremely high in the sky but you could still faintly see the green and red lights. It was so high that you know it couldn't be any sort of tower.  What is odd that a star was sitting right to the left of this object and you could see them both fairly well although the star was much brighter. Cloud cover came in and I could no longer see the object but it was just sitting there for about 20 minutes.  I have no idea if this was the same object or a different object.  I will be on the lookout this evening.  This was our experience.  This is what we saw and I'm just glad I had a witness.  My gut tells me that this is our own craft because when it first de-materialized or appeared it would've been in the air space here.", "stats": "Occurred : 6/18/2017 20:08  (Entered as : 06/18/2017 8:08) Reported: 6/19/2017 1:29:45 AM 01:29 Posted: 6/22/2017 Location: Chiang Rai (Thailand),  Shape: Unknown Duration:2 minutes", "date_time": "6/18/17 20:08", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/134/S134659.html", "city": "Chiang Rai (Thailand)", "state": null, "shape": "Unknown", "duration": "2 minutes", "summary": "I was outside grilling on our patio.

This was a sighting that I experienced back in 1991, and although 26 years have passed, I thought I would document my experience here for the record.   On or about May 31, 1991, I was sitting in a recliner in my back yard by the pool.

I stared at this object for several minutes and it seemed to be at a very high altitude and just stood there motionless.   After staring at the object, I noticed a strange feeling as though they were surveying the entire Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  I also had a strange feeling as though they knew I was watching them.  It is hard to describe, but it seems there was some kind of telepathic presence.  It made me feel slightly uneasy.   After watching the object for approximately another five minutes, this bright small dot of an object just \"popped\" out of view.  One second it was there, the next, it was gone.

My wife and I saw three glowing spheres of pure golden white light.  The middle sphere was the same size thereabout as the basketball hall of fame building in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The other two spheres were by its side and were much smaller.   You can\u2019t really say one sphere was on the left and the other on the right because they were spheres.  All sides are continual and perpetual.  But from my perspective one small sphere was on the left and the other was on the right of the large sphere. This craft would oscillate its light and shimmer.  It moved from side to side and when the craft moved, all the spheres would move together as one body.  Their movement was as if the spheres were connected by some kind of rod, but no such thing was visible.   This was not your typical alien space craft.  It wasn\u2019t a take me to your leader kind of craft like a round saucer plate with a bubble on top or a cigar shaped thing.  It wasn\u2019t a weather balloon either.   I never believed that aliens or spaceships like this ever existed.  I never believed stories of space ship photos.  So now what do I do?  I am looking at an amazing space ship.   It made no sound, not even when it flew away.  And when it did fly away it moved in a beautiful graceful curvy pattern and just flew right up into the stars until it blended in with them and ultimately just disappeared from sight.

{"text": "Huge Craft Really Close With After Effects So back in August of 1995, I had decided it was due time to leave the east coast.  At 23 years old I had grown up in Virginia my whole life and my soul just knew there was much more to see and do.  Little did I know, just how much more there was.  So I bought a motorhome and headed out west.  I had stocked the motorhome with enough food and camping supplies to last for months and set out for Boulder, Colorado.......free, single, and on top of the world.  As life has it, I was only there for a couple of weeks and ran into a gal from South Carolina who was on a similar journey that changed all that. After a short time of running the streets of Boulder together we left out for the Four Corners area, where Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico meet.  I had met a group of new friends she was hanging out with that were our age and we decided we would all head deep up into the national forest and live off grid for a month or so.  Upon arriving, the dirt road we took up into the forest was a little perilous and saw us more than once with a road span of 9ft, in a camper with a width of 8ft, and a sheer 200-300ft cliff off the passenger side.  We were all glad to arrive safely and the group of us set up camp using tents, tipi's, hammocks and some makeshift shelters.  Her and I were kind of spoiled in the camper with the comfort of heat at night, a cooking stove and a soft bed to lay our heads. After a month or so it had started to get pretty cold in the mountains and we decided to part ways.  A small group of us piled up in my motorhome and made our way back out of the woods, back to the highway and set off for our next journey to Sedona, Arizona.  For those who aren't aware, Sedona is home to of one of a small handful of vortexes on the planet.  A vortex or vortexes are areas of concentrated energy rising from the earth. Many people believe that Sedona has several vortexes or power spots, making Sedona a highly sought-after spiritual and metaphysical destination. As you approach the town of Sedona, even though its in the desert, you have to go down a very long steep and winding road.  The brakes on the camper started to make noise and by the time we got to the bottom, they were completely shot making a fierce grinding noise. The first place I could pull into was the local Post Office and I immediately parked.  Running low on funds we weren't exactly sure how we were going to solve this problem.  By coincidence, if you believe in such things, as we exited the camper, a man was just parking to go in and must have smelled our dilemma.  It just so happened that he was a local johnny on the spot mechanic, and after a brief explanation from us he offered a hot shower and to fix the breaks for free. He directed us to roll the rest of the way thru town and told us of a free camping area about a mile on the other side.  A few hours later he arrived with a friend and tools and within a short time they had replaced all four brakes.  We were very grateful..... We ended up staying at this very primitive camping area for about a week and during that time him and his friend came by a frequently.  We kind of befriended his friend more than him. He was about 7 ft tall with the build of an pro wrestler and we soon found out he had anger issues.  After some time together, his friend, a little more mild tempered, invited me and my companion back to his family's home to take a break from the road and to get a home cooked meal.  After intruding on his family for a few days he and his wife asked if we wanted to go to a good place in the desert they knew of to camp.  It was just outside of Cottonwood, Arizona, which was the next town down the road. As we approached the area I noticed I was in a completely different environment than ever before.  The cacti were everywhere and the sagebrush truly rolled.  The only thing higher than a basketball goal was one mountain range with no trees about a mile away.  It wasn't even a camping area, we just kind of pulled up into the middle of the desert and the only sign of human life were some rocks piled up in a circle for fires.  We all had planned on staying in the camper so it didn't take too long to set up camp. After a light lunch we all decided to go for a desert walk and probably stopped about 3/4 a mile from camp before heading back.  As we were walking and talking I started hearing from a distance behind us a high pitched noise that progressively got louder, the more we walked.  The next thing I knew the couple we were with, not saying anything, started to pick up their pace.  The closer we got back to the camper the louder and louder the noise became till all four of us were at a fast jog.  We threw open the door to the camper and piled on top of eachother getting inside to have a few dozen wild hogs all about a foot and a half tall stampede under and around us.  The camper swayed as they passed by. We stayed in the camper for some time after that but getting hungry and out of cooking propane we decided enough time had passed for us to build a fire outside.  Dinner was good and it had been a long day and the couple we were with wanted to retire so we thought we would give them some space and grabbed a few blankets and headed up on the roof of the camper to bed down for the night, letting them stay inside. Getting caught up in conversation with nothing but the stars and our new found love for each other, hours must have passed and it was probably approaching midnight when I first noticed how beautiful that plain old mountain range looked in the eve of night.  The moon was high behind it, making it really stand out.  It was then that I noticed what looked like a Jeep or some kind of all terrain vehicle on the cusp of the hill which was only about three humps rolling out of the earth and probably only 1000ft high at there peak.  All's that I could make out at that time was what looked like a large headlight traveling along.   Finding it a bit unusual I continued watching as it traveled at a slow pace along the curvature of the mountain till I noticed it had turned towards us and seemed to be leaving the mountain.  That's when I nudged my new friend to take a look.  Within about 3 minutes,which seemed like 20, it had traveled from the top of the hill to almost overhead of us and I could feel her scootch herself close to my side. It was probably the size of a half of a football field with slightly rounded corners on the bottom and almost as tall as it was long, more rounded at the top.  There were multiple pairs of very oddly colored red and green lights not in any kind of symmetrical order on the bottom that seemed to be twisting more like a barbers pole than flashing.  It made no noise...that's 0 noise...and we were in the middle of the desert so you could hear everything. It slowly made its way over our heads only about 3-400 feet above us and had slowed to 5 mph as it was directly above.  As it traveled past us about another football fields length we watched without blinking as it went into warp speed and within about 6-7 seconds it was out of sight doing a slight twisting incline as it went...still never making a sound.  We both looked at each other in the darkness of night both knowing what we had just experienced, hoping it was over....but it wasn't...... As we sat on the top of the camper quietly contemplating what had just happened, these perfectly round bubbles started appearing all around us on the ground.  They looked like thick plastic with a dull light in them and we heard scurrying in the brush.  I wasn't clear if the scurrying was due to what was happening or maybe rodents getting out of the bubbles way.  I had chills running down my spine and goosebumps all over.  This lasted another 5 minutes or so till they just slowly disappeared......and we were ok..... This young lady later became my wife and after 2 decades we love to share this with anyone that will listen.  Most people don't really believe but we know different. Seeing is believing. It changed our lives forever. **So I did a little research and it seems the mountain where I was facing outside of Cottonwood, Arizona, is called Mingus Mountain.....Just thought I'd share that. It was right at the highest peak when it came towards us....

A spokesman for Nav Canada at Kelowna International Airport says he was not made aware of anything being picked up on radar, likely ruling out a plane of any sort. Whatever the object, it caught the attention of Trevor Shipalesky and his daughter. They were driving in West Kelowna near Gorman Bros. mill about 7:30 last evening, when he says his daughter noticed the lights. \"I looked up and saw at least five or six of these balls. They were bouncing up and down, and doing all kinds of weird stuff,\" he said. \"They were flashing too. I couldn't believe my eyes.  Were they flares, planes, fighter jets? But, I quickly realized they weren't any of those.\"   Shipalesky says he grabbed his phone, but in his excitement, forgot to push record. Before he realized he was not filming, Shipalesky said the objects appeared to be below the cloud line, and possible below the mountains. \"They were not making any noise. These things were dead silent.\"  When he did finally begin to record, Shipalesky said you can see five or six moving in a Vee formation. And, above those, there were three or four more.

{"text": "Triangle, Chrome, 2 Lights, Indiana I was in High School, at the time, and my family lived in the country on a gravel road.  I walked to the end of our long driveway so I could stand and wait for the bus to pick me up. The neighbors' house was a quarter mile down the road to my right, and across the road.  I noticed something like a bright star sitting above the neighbors house just above the tree line, but it was too cloudy to see stars that morning.   I walked out to the middle of the road and shouted \"hey!\" and waved to see if anyone was outside that I could see.  Then I noticed the light started to move slowly.  I backed up to my usual standing spot and watched as it moved diagonally towards the road and me at a 45 degree angle.  It matched my distance from the road and moved parallel to it now towards me.  It moved slowly as it got closer I realized I still didn't know what it was.   I became terrified.  It looked as though it were made of chrome, and it was slightly larger than a car.  It was shaped like a bloated triangle with rounded edges and corners with two white lights on one edge.  The lights weren't all that bright, but I noticed its movement was not related to the lights.  It moved towards me with an edge at the front and a corner to its rear and both the lights were on its right rear edge.  When it was directly above me it stopped.  It sat above me motionless, and silent.  Within about a minute, it vanished.  Something wasn't right about the way it disappeared.  I'm not sure if it moved up until it blended with the clouds, or if it literally disappeared.  It must have seen my bus coming down the road because as soon as I realized that I couldn't see it anymore, I heard the bus engine in the distance.  I didn't tell anyone about it though.  For the next few years I payed close attention to anything unusual above the neighbors house.  I saw the same thing again the next spring when daylight savings time changed.  The second time I just hid behind a tree and waited! for the bus.  When I heard the bus I looked and it was gone.   I saw it again a few months after that and decided to stand in my usual bus spot and ignore it. It disappeared within a few seconds though. The strangest thing about all of this is that the UFO was always above the neighbors' house.  The guy who lived there was a simple farmer, and his son had advanced multiple sclerosis.  He was basically a vegetable.  The teenager had died a few years later from what I heard.   I don't know what it was that I saw, and I don't have a clue what it was doing.

Also, it's worth noting that the nearest airport is MILES away and the nearest big city is hours away.  Our town has more cows than people, and the residents are mostly elderly farmers.  We both agreed we needed to check it out because we had animals to look after, as well as private property to defend. As soon as we got into my mother's car and crossed the road, it started to move.  We followed it towards the back of the farm.  Suddenly it disappeared so we stopped and waited.  There was no noise, not even crickets.  Suddenly it appeared behind us to the south so we reversed and continued to follow it as it randomly descended and ascended.  It led us back north before disappearing once more.  Then it reappeared again with a second oval.  They hovered in the air for a few minutes before suddenly taking off and disappearing. We've never seen either one of the ovals of light again.  Both of us have good mental health, good eyesight, and decent instinct.  The reason I hadn't reported it was due to the fact no one would believe us.  So I soon forgot about it.  But this morning my mother brought it up and we tried to figure out what it was again, and I felt it was time to finally report it.

{"text": "I was driving on a very clear day, without a single cloud in the sky.  At an intersection, I noticed a silver object in the sky, which i presumed to be a very low flying 747 which struck me to be odd as I was 60 to 70 plus miles away from Ohare and Midway airports.   Looking at it closer, I noticed it was not moving.  I took off my sunglasses to see if I could see it better, but as soon as I did, that it disappeared.  Putting them back on, you could easily see it again.  I figured this was related to the polarized lens....very weird though.  I immediately changed my direction to head north towards it.  Driving very fast, I was only about 2 miles from the object that was only about 3,000 feet in the air.  I had never seen anything like this in my life.  As I got closer the object began to move.   At this time, I immediately felt light headed and a headache ensued (which I rarely get...related idk).  At the same moment hundreds of birds began to flock away from the object from the adjacent tree line.   It changed its direction a few times and began to head north.  I hopped on I-57 towards Chicago and drove very fast so I would not lose sight of it.  As I did this, the craft picked up incredible speeds towards increased altitude dramatically.  If I had to guess, roughly 15 times faster than a typical 747, but this is likely an underestimate.   I was dumbfounded, concluding the only explanation is new military technology or extraterrestrial.  Unfortuantely, the object moved so fast that it disappeared in the distance in less than 30 to 45 seconds.   I decided I would turn around at the next exit at this point as it was long gone.  I slowed down a bit because I noticed an unmarked all black police car flashing white, yellow, red, and blue lights pulled off on the side of the interstate.  I could not identify the model, as it was a car I had never seen before, and I know my cars very well.  I would say the closest car would be a Chrysler 300 with a sleek body kit, maybe it's the 2018 version.  Who knows.   As I approached it, I noticed it had US Government plates, with no other vehicles pulled over next to it, and I could not see into the windows as I passed, they were tinted which striked me as odd.  I thought it might be related to the presence of the craft so I kept driving past the next exit.   I continued on the expressway for another 10 to 12 miles to see if anything odd would appear.  As I began to merge into the right lane to get off the expressway I saw it again...maybe 10 miles West of me hovering above a radio tower.  At this point I tried to snap a photo, but figured it would not work as I could not see the object without my polarized lens.  I got off the freeway and headed west towards the object which was likely above Frankfort, IL.   At this point I noticed a prop plane heading towards it from the east and two dark planes flying in formation from the north.  At this point I was only a few miles away from it, but as the jets approached the craft it accelerated south at a very high speeds.  The best pa! rt was the fact you could see it breaking the sound barrier within a matter of a few seconds.  It picked up speeds so fast and headed into the skies where I lost sight of it within 10 seconds. I pulled off the road to turn around and see what types of planes where approaching.  They were two fighter jets, maybe the F35 but I couldn't say definitely.  They had no chance of keeping up with the object though.  I hopped back on the freeway and on my way back home I noticed a strong presence of police cars.  I saw 15-20 in the 20 minute drive home.  As I approached my town I noticed more police lights, a fire truck, and ambulance which was weird because it was right where I began to have a headache.  There was a car in the ditch on one side of the road and two cars that collided at the intersection.  Maybe it was just all a coincidence though, but it was very odd coincidence.  I reviewed the photos I took and I managed to capture the object on one of them, which I will upload. I watched the six o'clock news to see if anyone else reported it, but no news at all regarding craft, military testing, fighter jets, etc.  Hoping someone will see this post and possibly confirm some of these events.   Lastly, I have been keeping an eye out for an odd activity over the last few days.  I noticed a strange, constant light that traveled much faster than the any of the other planes that fly over my house the night after the initial sighting.  Additionally, I worked outside the day after and today on the landscaping.  I kept hearing roaring jet engines over the house. This occured 6 or 7 times since I saw the object on thd 7th.  Unfortunately, it has been cloudy here since then, but I can only confirm that I saw a fighter jet on two of these occasions during the day.  I've lived hear since 2004 and have only seen a fighter jet once so all of this is very odd.  Hope someone else can provide an explanation.  Thanks.   Note: the attached photo is the original unedited photo.  It has the object on the right side, if you zoom on you can see the radio tower in the distance 10 to 15 miles away or so.  It is directly above the radio tower.", "stats": "Occurred : 6/7/2017 15:00  (Entered as : 06/07/2017 15:00) Reported: 6/9/2017 10:50:46 PM 22:50 Posted: 6/15/2017 Location: Manteno, IL Shape: Disk Duration:30 minutes", "date_time": "6/7/17 15:00", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/134/S134502.html", "city": "Manteno", "state": "IL", "shape": "Disk", "duration": "30 minutes", "summary": "I was driving on a very clear day, without a single cloud in the sky.

While merging back on the westbound I-8 from the Ligurta Truck Parking area, just west of Welton, AZ, between 9:30 and 10:00pm, Thursday, 6/8/17, I noticed a V-shaped cluster of yellow lights in the southern sky toward Mexico.  After a few seconds, they disappeared all at once with a slight decay.  It looked like someone had turned off distant, but powerful, lights, and it took a second for the filament to fully dim.  Could also have been them disappearing behind distant clouds.  It was confusing and I thought maybe I had witnessed some sort of reflection onto my drivers side car window that went away as I drove.

{"text": "Drone-like sphere follows airplane in clear afternoon sky, then veers slowly away, before vanishing. At my apartment complex, I had just walked out to toss trash in a dumpster, when I heard, and then saw, a Cessna model 172 flying in an Easterly direction, above the trees and housing area nearby.  The sky was blue, and without any clouds.  The Cessna flew at an altitude that suggested it would land at nearby Fullerton airport.  It was perhaps about one quarter mile south of my location. Just a moment after looking at the Cessna airplane, I noticed a mostly round shaped object, about one third the length of the Cessna in size, was flying just slightly higher and behind the Cessna plane.  The object was colored mainly white and black, and had a single and very bright white light near its top that flashed regularly, like a beacon or strobe. The object flew on at a slower speed than the Cessna, and I followed it for about one minute as it flew farther away and farther South than the track the Cessna had taken.  When the object was then just a tiny point in the clear sky, it suddenly just vanished.  I watched for another minute or so, but it never came back. The best thing I can compare the object to would be the flying \u2018drone balls\u2019 that are in the Tom Cruise Science-Fiction film called \u201cOblivion\u201d.  The object flew and looked much like those round drones in that movie, though I estimate it to have been much larger in size than those in the film were.  Maybe the size of a Smart Car or Fiat 500. I believe whatever this object was, that it was a remotely controlled vehicle.  Whether it was of an alien origin, or a secret military device, I can only speculate at this point.  But I can say that it is the second time I have seen a drone-like UFO flying in the vicinity of my apartment in Anaheim, seeing another one just last year, also in the afternoon daylight hours.

I was using the binoculars to watch a family of falcons near the woodline to the south of where I was sitting.  It was a hot, clear day.  Not a cloud in the sky, visibility was for miles from the sky, I'm sure.  There were also high flying aircraft in the sky that day, and from time to time I was pointing the binoculars to get a look at the aircraft and their contrails.  I've been an aviation enthusiast for my entire life and have attended countless airshows featuring both military and civilian aircraft.  There was an aircraft flying at high altitude, leaving a contrail.  I followed it with the binoculars as it traveled from south to the north.   After following it for approximately 10 seconds or so, I noticed a strange metallic glint just to what would have been the aircraft's 8 o'clock.  I remember thinking, \"wow.. that plane is close to the other one..\" but then realized that this object wasn't moving, and wasn't leaving contrails like all the other aircraft at that altitude were.  I pulled the binoculars away to see if I could see the object without the aid of the optics, but I couldn't - so I looked through them again, found the object again.  It was completely stationary.  Definitely metallic.  I remember seeing the sun glimmering off the surface.   It was far away, and I was using 7x50 power binoculars..

{"text": "UFO Report 06/09/2017.  On Friday, June 9, 2017, my two friends and were at Smokemont Campground just outside Cherokee, NC, in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  We were not staying there, but had driven there from a neighboring town where we live, specifically to see the synchronized fireflies event that happens in late May, or early April, every year. We parked and decided to walk along the path along the creek to first see the \u201cglow worms\u201d that my friends discovered the year before in the root bank of a tree up the hill that had a small spring in it.  Tiny glow worms, but they're nonetheless, cool. We walked back to the campground, found the darkest spot away from the camp fires, set up our chairs, and waited for the show (synchronized fireflies event).  The turnout was low, probably because it was cool, and there was a full moon (strawberry moon, in fact). I had just gotten back from a short walk down the road, and when I returned, I noticed that my friends were looking up at something in the sky.  Naturally, I looked up and there in the sky was a white glowing object, seemed to be round in shape.  At first it looked like a giant firefly but it was too high up in the sky.  The first thing I noticed, was there were no blinking lights like an airplane.  It continued in a line, then stopped, then moved forward, then seems to turn on its side like a tire rolling down a road and disappeared.  The whole encounter lasted 20-40 seconds.  There was no sound and I would have expected a sound since it was that close to us.  The time was around 10:30 pm. Two of us early saw the object stop and hover. We left and the park and headed home.  On the way, several cars were stopped in both directions, and we could see an elk on the side of the road.  We thought that was all that there was but as we passed, we saw an elk calf was down in the road, likely hit by a car.   Being that we were from the area and the others were likely tourists, my friend called her friend that works in the park to determine who we should call about the incident.

It appeared to be quite low in the sky, was quiet, and moved slowly.  A shimmering light passed all over the bottom of the craft several times, independent of the five V-formation lights.  I watched it cross the sky until I couldn\u2019t make it out any longer.  I\u2019m not far from Stewart International Airport (public/military), and suppose it might have been a military plane. Of note, the street lamp on the corner went out while the craft passed over, then started glowing slightly until it reached the normal light, seemed to get brighter than usual and orange-tinted, and abruptly went out again.

The red light was too far into the sky to be a drone.  I did not notice any other lights in the sky, but for stars.  It was making me crazy that I had no one to witness this, and my cell phone was dead.  I suddenly saw 2 teenage girls in the field to my left.  I shouted down to them and asked if they too could see the light from where they stood (I was up higher on the street, and the field was below me).  At 1st they could not see it because they were looking in the wrong direction.  Once they spotted it, they both yelled...what is that.  All the sudden it began to shrink in size until it was gone..about 3 seconds.  They both started shouting what was that..thanked me for showing to them..and I drove off.  The light was too far away to be a drone and way too far in the sky.  Too see my vantage point, you can google Key Stone Oaks High School,  My Lebanon, PA.  I was parked on Delwood Ave. in Dormont, PA.  I'd say I was looking toward the Southern Sky when I saw it.  This is driving me crazy!!

{"text": "Black object with luminescence seen in western sky moving south east. At about 10:15 A.M., I was talking to my neighbor outside on my porch, when I noticed high in the western sky a black orb looking object with luminescence.  I then ran inside and grabbed my camera.  The object was slowly moving south east, but stopped and changed directions several times, even moving north.  There were times when it was not moving at all.  It also seemed to cloak at times and bi-locate once (jump from one space to another) and there may have been a couple other white orbs in the vicinity.   It's hard to describe the shape of this object, and I will let the video footage speak for itself.  It was not a balloon because it was changing directions, stopping, appeared to cloak a few times, and was even motionless at times.  My neighbor and I witnessed these strange aerial phenomena for about twenty minutes.  They just seemed to vanish into thin air and disappeared out of site.   I was unable to capture on video the other orbs because there were no background clouds for reference, so I couldn't see them in my camera.  I was astonished at what I was seeing.  The object just seemed to vanish in thin air as it was heading north.  I have two video clips.  The one with me talking is at normal speed.  It is quite shaky, because I did not have a tripod.  In the second clip, I slowed the video down two times and added a sound effect for entertainment purposes.

This occurred as it went south west to north east over head lasting about a minute before I lost both objects behind some thin clouds.

{"text": "A large plane being followed by a triangular shaped craft Thursday May 18, 2017-12:21 PM, Spokane Valley, WA  It was noonish on Thursday.  I was working in the backyard.  I heard a plane and casually glanced up.  I to had to look again because I didn't understand what I was looking at.  I saw a large plane, like a 747, with what looked like a triangle flying next to it. I was looking to the north.  The plane was flying east, at fairly high altitude.  There was silver or white triangle flying on the right side of the plane just back from the nose of the plane.  The triangle was shaped like a very narrow paper airplane.  It was traveling at the same speed as the plane and was about half as long as the plane. I watched the two fly above a cloud and then come out the other side.  As soon as they hit the cloud, I ran for my phone but, by the time I got my phone on they were too far away to see on my camera. I know what I saw. It was in the middle of the afternoon on a sunny day with a few clouds.  The plane could not have taken off at our local airport because of its high altitude.  Had it taken off at GEG, it would have been much lower.  However, Fairchild AF base is very near the airport.   I guess maybe it could have been one of their planes.

{"text": "Stopped to assist several entities. I'm not sure how this fits in but the experience has stayed with me; and I had to post something. I am a long haul driver and was travelling east on Interstate 8, just east of Fortuna, Arizona. Having checked the clock, it was 3:45 AM when I alerted my partner to the presence of three or four individuals standing in the middle of the traffic lane.  After sounding the truck horn, I began to slow our rig.  Given the fact that the area is well known for human smuggling and is dangerous to travel, I wondered if, perhaps, we should keep going. But, when it became apparent that at least three of the individuals were wearing some kind of uniform, I decided to stop along the right shoulder.  Nevertheless, my second driver emerged from the sleeper with the shotgun that we carry.  Both of us agreed that neither of us was going to step from the cab, and we kept the engine idling. Three individuals walked slowly toward me, toward the driver's side of the cab.  At about fifteen feet, I could tell that all three of them were suited, if you will, in some sort of gear. I wondered if the Marines, from the nearby Marine Corps air station, had crashed and were going to ask us for help. As I lowered the driver's window, the shortest of the three, bundled in heavy white gear, with what looked like white armor around the chest, and a partial faceplate that emerged from below the chin, said to me, in perfect English, \"Not to worry, we have a minor situation.\"   He (it) motioned with his left arm toward the distance, off the highway.  It was strange because neither my partner nor I saw anything as we approached the group but, sure enough, something was putting out intense red flames, maybe fifty feet off the right shoulder from where we were parked. Before I could say anything, a triangle-shaped wedge of the landscape to our right, with the flames at the base of the triangle, rose up and sliced through the truck cab.  For lack of a better description, I felt like I was looking at some kind of image--as it came through the cab. I mean, the individual who spoke to me appeared first on the left side near me, and then appeared on the right side, the raised side, then on both sides, which appeared raised. My throat was so dry, my stomach in knots; honestly, I felt like I was going to heave. I figured we had it.  Three individuals, two in white, wearing helmets, and one who appeared burned or blackened and without a helmet, appeared in the image to our right, as they made their way around chunks of rock, walking towards our cab.  There was a lot of communication, like radio, between them, or between somebody. The one who had spoken to me, after I had lowered the window, now sounded metallic. So I turned once again towards the voice, to my left again, toward the open window and he (or it) wasn't there.  I turned toward my partner, in the right front seat, who was still cradling the shotgun, nothing. I mean, it was black. It was perfectly silent.  There were no flames off to the right in the distance. Our clock showed 5:15 AM, only the entire encounter felt like it had lasted fifteen minutes or so.  I don't know what to claim.

It was a fairly clear night but the elevation of the object was unclear.  The object was brighter than the stars behind it and was moving north to south from my location in Murrieta, CA.   I decided to watch the object to see if it had the blinking lights that you would typically see on an aircraft such as an airplane or helicopter.  As I watched the object I never saw any of those blinking lights. Then the strange part happened.  The object gained speed over the Temecula valley and it also started to rapidly gain altitude.

This all happened in a time span of about 2 minutes.  I continued to watch the sky for several more minutes and I did not see any sign of the object again.

While in between games at my daughter's softball tournament I had a very brief thought of the 12 different anomalous flying objects I witnessed over a nine week period last fall.  This thought prompted me to have a glance at the sky.  All I saw was blue sky and one jet ascending out of LAX.  A moment later I looked up again to the east and saw what at first thought seemed like four helium balloons ascending separately a few hundred feet apart at an estimated 500 feet elevation.three appeared white and one had a dark metallic color.  Their trajectories at first were consistent with helium party balloons.  After three or four minutes watching the objects had receded from orb shape to point light sources and three of the four collard a convergent path while the fourth remained at a distance.  It was at this point that I expected the objects to appear as black dots and plane out with the upper level! winds if they were balloons.  Instead they appeared more and more as light sources getting continuously further away.  After ten minutes of continuous watching the lights were not discernible.

{"text": "Saturday May 20th, 2017, 11:30 p.m.  Silver Lake Kansas.  New moon so no moon that night, perfectly clear and windless, about 55-60\u00ba with a little moisture in the air from rains earlier that morning and the days before. A triangular shaped object that was cut in half a gap about 1/8 the total width of the object;straight down the middle making it appear as 2 separate objects to form one.  It materialized as a dimly illuminated condensation cloud/fog that disappeared just as quick as it came. My girlfriend and I were stargazing in the backyard of her stepdads house in the country, about 6 miles northwest of Topeka.  The only visible light was from the windows of the house.  We both were staring directly over our heads as the object seemed to go thru the moist air at a unmeasurable velocity of speed.  It was traveling due west and appeared for 1-2 secs.  It was as if it were cloaked and the vapor it caused were the only means of visibility. The only reference to size is my index and thumb about a inch, inch and a half apart with my arm fully extended in front of my field of view looking straight in the sky. Which the only visible portion of the objects travel path being about directly above us to over a tree that stands maybe 25 ft high to the west of us on the south side of the fence which on the other side is hundreds of acres of farming fields. From 1st sight directly above us; to disapperance; it covered this vast part of sky above us almost to the horizon in a matter of seconds, 2 max.  We were sitting inside the fenced in backyard of chain about belly button high.  We sat in a backwards leaning lawn chair with my girlfriend sitting directly on my lap with the back of her head on my shoulder so we both had the same field of view.  We had a blanket 3ft behind us on a clothes line which we used as a block of the ambient light of the house windows. The light it illuminated was almost rainbow spectrum In There Was No Solid Color To Associate With It.  I saw it flash above which is what drew my eyes, it being dark out i thought maybe my eyes were tricking me, so I asked my girlfriend if she \"just saw that,\" and at the same time as if she was gonna say the samething and finished by answering the question, she said she wasn\u2019t going to say anything cause she thought her eyes were messing with her also, and \"umm...yeah i ((word deleted)) saw that!\"  Even if we had the equipment to record the sky that night we would\u2019ve needed about 6 cameras in night vision coving as much of the sky as possible and it would have been a one in a million chance of actually capturing it. I've been interested in RESEARCHING the unknown as pertains to ufo and ebe\u2019s, to secret dark government/military space programs.  With all the channels I subscribe to and talk shows I listen to it was just a matter of time before my girlfriend would become interested in the subject herself but it was not until a few days ago that the 1st ufo sighting I\u2019ve experienced and hers as well which brought all the things she hears me listening to and watching become something brought to fruition, a experience, something that was just a subject until we had a 1st hand witnessing  of something almost indescribable due to it or anything similar in nature have never been reported by anyone worldwide (to our knowledge) which created way more questions than the simple satisfaction of just observing an anomaly. That experience has turned my ole lady who is a former collegiate gymnast that gives private lessons to people who would let something like this make them think I'm \"one of them people\" and id have no clients for income.  From that standpoint  To now another believer via 1st hand experience.  In the years of interest in the subject and years of listening to coast to coast I have never heard anything close to describing the sighting that we had.  With the Uniqueness of the appearance of the object materializing/causing a disturbance in the air which gave shape, speed and size. Im a graphic artist and am currently opening my own costom silk screen printing  and tattoo shop.  I've been in the tshirt business for about 2 1/2 years running a store in downtown topeka. sometimes solo and still pushing out 300 shirts worth of orders.  On breaks id watch videos and as a graphic artist was highly disappointed in all the cgi and disinformation  out there that i didnt know what to/not to look for. Hence this being my 1st in 35 years of life. The reason I'm reporting this is due to its unique nature and the curiosity it spewed out of me. Wondering if anyone anywhere at anytime has experienced anything similar at all. That night we also observed a few other unexplainable events that we have never experienced. One being a unknown light due south of us close to the kansas river, about 1-2 miles away and what appeared 200-300ft above the ground, as we were looking upward, in the lower peripheral of our vision the light just appeared out of nowhere ad grew in intensity to the point of illuminating part o the sky, as the flash happened we looked for the light which had vanished as quickly as it appeared. Another light like that also appeared on the western horizon about a hour after the river one. We also witnessed what appeared as \u201cstars\u201d moving a high rate of speed. 2 of them going directly north to a south southwest direction. The third one seemed to come from the southwest and curved back towards the north west with another light directly behind it about 10-15 seconds. All of these id probably hafta say were satellites in orbit and maybe the iss. We witnessed what seemed to be a couple military aircraft that were flying directly across from each other maybe 10miles wing tip to wing tip at the same altitude and velocity with nothing but a red light to identify both of them as they came out of the western horizon and disappearing into the eastern horizon. Around 12:15 we witnessed a \u201caircraft\u201d with A Single Bright Yellowish Light That Didn\u2019t Flash, traveled north to south but the thing that caught our attention was the erratic movements. It seemed to glitch, the best ways to describe it. It\u2019d seem to stand still for a couple seconds then dash forward, move left and right in very jerky, not smooth at all movement.  The best I can describe it is visual glitching causing it to skip fwd in space to make up for the time that it was in a static position.  Only explanation I have for that one is maybe the air temps and atmospheric variables that makes stars twinkle and seem to oscillate light intensities.", "stats": "Occurred : 5/20/2017 22:30  (Entered as : 05/20/17 22:30) Reported: 5/23/2017 12:45:01 AM 00:45 Posted: 6/2/2017 Location: Silver Lake, KS Shape: Triangle Duration:2 seconds", "date_time": "5/20/17 22:30", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/134/S134218.html", "city": "Silver Lake", "state": "KS", "shape": "Triangle", "duration": "2 seconds", "summary": "Saturday May 20th, 2017 11:30 p.m. Silver Lake, KS.

{"text": "Heard popping sound.. then looking up, saw glowing ball above cigar shaped object. On May 21, I [a State HVAC contractor] was visiting a friend who owns an International Security firm.  We were at his home, just outside Jonesborough Tenn., when sometime in the afternoon as we were chatting, there was a popping sound above us.  Looking up we saw a small white light.  I say 'we', but he saw it first.  It was so small, it took me a few seconds to locate it. It didn't appear to be moving, so I grabbed my small 10x25 binoculars and focused in on it.  There was a shiney ball-shaped object that seemed to pulsate light, and under the light was a cigar shaped object that was pointing down, approxamately 30^ angle to the left.  There would be a pulse of light and the CS object was then pointing 30^ to the right.  These pulses occured approx. 3 seconds apart, with the object moving from one angle to the other, with each pulse. The distance of the CS object from the glowing mass was about 1/4 the length of the CS object.  The CS object itself was about 4-5 times the length of the lights diameter.  Other than its rounded ends, the body shape was constant.. like a cigar. It was difficult to guage how high it was, and it didn't appear to be decending.  It moved slowly to the west, as if it were drifting.. always at the same hight.  The entire experiance lasted 5-10 minutes. After giving it thought, it could have been something that was dropped from a higher vessle and when reaching a certain altitude, metalic parashoots opened.. which would acount for the 'popping' sound. The shifting degree's of the cigar could have been a 'swinging' motion, IF it was hanging.  Sunlight bouncing off metalic shoots could give the appearance of pulsating, stabalizing rockets, even though I've never seen or heard of 'metallic' para-shoots.

Reasons being, as soon as the plane passed by these objects got so close to each other creating like a wall and quickly moved out the way of the plane.   During this time the objects also change from their white color to a black color as if they felt in danger by the plane.   After the plane was out the frame these object continued to fly in abnormal directions in the sky.  I filmed them for about a minute and half before they finally just fanished into thin air.   The crazy thing is I saw two objects similar to these object about 4 days ago and also filmed it.  I dont know what they are but when I zoomed in to the objects they definitely weren't anything I have ever seen.  They were round with like two long black I guess poles at the top and bottom of the objects.   After everything happened.  I went back inside my building and for some reason I felt really angry and agitated.  I felt this way for about 5 minutes.   I hope I can spot some more UFOs in the future.", "stats": "Occurred : 6/15/2017 10:03  (Entered as : 06/15/17 10:03) Reported: 6/15/2017 11:56:16 AM 11:56 Posted: 6/15/2017 Location: Denver, CO Shape: Formation Duration:5 minutes", "date_time": "6/15/17 10:03", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/134/S134590.html", "city": "Denver", "state": "CO", "shape": "Formation", "duration": "5 minutes", "summary": "I was doing a patrol of my buildings perimeter on 06/15/17 around 10:03AM.

{"text": "Military jet cases 2 Ufos flying in tandem right above 50 witnesses immediately after an amber diamond shaped craft is sighted Long Description of Sighting Report Incredible video footage of a military jet chasing a UFO (yeah, that's right, chasing one) right over our heads while out at the infamous Giant Rock in Landers while at this year's Contact in the Desert (CITD) conference in Joshua Tree, Calif.  I, Melinda Leslie, was leading my Sunday night, May 21st, Sky Watch with Night Vision Goggle Intensive out at Giant Rock on the 3rd night of viewing events for CITD.  Luckily one of my participants, Graham Slater, caught this and many of our other sightings (from all 3 nights no less), with his black and white night vision video camera.  His additional footage of some of the other incredible sightings will be posted at a future date once they are compiled. Here's a description of the jet chase sighting:  At just before 10:00 p.m. (did not note exact time) some of my participants and I saw a large amber colored light low to the horizon just behind Giant Rock from where my whole group of about 50 plus people were gathered and using 15 pair of night vision goggles.  A contigenecy of about 20 of us ran to get a better view of it.  To the naked eye it appeared to be a large orangish (amber) light, that quoting some of the 20 people; \"flew like a bumble bee.\"  One guest, [name removed/CMS/jpg], came running with a pair of the goggles in hand and got a good look at it.  She said that through the goggles it looked like \"a large diamond shaped UFO.\"  She drew a picture of it attached here.  This object then flew behind a small hill right behind the entire Sky Watch larger group.  As those of us who ran off walked back to join the others, 3 military jets flew over in the direction of the object now gone from sight behind the hill.  Some of us commented that \"if\" \"they\" were following it, meaning the jets, they were a few minutes too late. Just then, we heard the sound of a low flying jet from behind the hill, and suddenly clearing the top of the hill and right over our heads, came a very fast military jet chasing a faster large red glowing light.  The military jet had both red and white blinking strobe lights and glowing afterburners and was VERY loud as it flew directly above our heads.  The large red light had NO blinking lights and NO sound at all!  It became clear to all 50 plus witnesses, this was NO jet!!!  Those folks present who looked with the aid of the goggles said they were seeing either 2 lights, or one object with 2 light sources on it.  After extensive review of the footage, I am nearly certain it shows 2 UFOs (fast moving lights), flying in perfect locked tandem with one another.  It appears you can see stars between them in the background suggesting that these are 2 separate objects. As is usually the case, this footage while incredible, does not do the sighting justice.  The video is in black and white night vision, not full-color naked-eye vision, and does not have any sound, so you are unable to hear the palatable excitement of 50 plus witnesses screaming and cheering.", "stats": "Occurred : 5/21/2017 22:00  (Entered as : 05/21/17 22:00) Reported: 6/1/2017 5:38:43 PM 17:38 Posted: 6/2/2017 Location: Landers (Yucca Valley), CA Shape: Diamond Duration:10 minutes", "date_time": "5/21/17 22:00", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/134/S134375.html", "city": "Landers (Yucca Valley)", "state": "CA", "shape": "Diamond", "duration": "10 minutes", "summary": "Military jet cases 2 Ufos flying in tandem right above 50 witnesses immediately after an amber diamond shaped craft is sighted", "posted": "6/2/17"}

{"text": "Unusually low lights that broke up and flashed about 20 minutes in Sumner, WA May 22, 2017  Yesterday was a beautiful warm day.  The sky was clear with patchy clouds here and there.  As it began getting dark, I was disappointed because as usual, the sky was overcast, and not many stars could be seen. Maybe around 11pm, I was outside having a smoke and looking up to the sky. Night before last, within about 10 minutes, I seen what I think were satellites.  Two separate tiny white lights, like specks, no flashing or any other colors just steady white light zoom across the sky.   Tonight, all of the sudden I see one solid white speck of light but it's much lower than the two that I seen the night before.  Travelling fast, steady white light. I grab the camera but my screen is broken so I can't see what I'm aiming at.  Pointed it in the direction of the light which I can see with my eyes but it's already a bit away from me.  I did manage to capture a few seconds of it on video but the quality is poor. I had some house chores to do and made a late dinner.  Remembered that I needed to send an email with photos attached so went upstairs to do so.  I'm borrowing a computer from a friend and not used to Windows 10 and had to figure out how to download the pics from my camera.  And I got sidetracked... Next thing I know, it's almost 4am!  I turn off the tv and look outside and quickly notice a super bright orange light in the flight path but it seems to be descending. It was very low, grabbed the camera and pointed in it's direction.  Then a bright white light comes from same direction and looks to be slowing down.  I took five separate videos because the lights were busy - doing something for probably 20  minutes.  Two of those videos did not come out. You can hear me on them but no video was recorded until the last few seconds of one. I was surprised and almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.  All together, I think there was at least four lights - low, and they would break into different lights flashing - at one point, the first two lights were making a cross of red, yellow and blue flashing very quickly but that doesn't show on the video.  I'm a bit embarassed of the quality of my video - it's extremely poor - Canon Powershot, video taken outside my upstairs bedroom win! dow through the screen.  Diidn't have another angle accessible for viewing. Got just a bit nervous towards the end of videoing because a couple of the lights seemed to flash close.  Don't know how to describe but my friend and I have captured many videos in the past and sometime when capturing unusual lights - it might not be noticed by the person filming at the time, but upon reviewing, it will seem like the light(s) will suddenly come up on you quick.  Oh, and my cat kept getting in the way.  In one of the videos, there's a weird sound, otherwise, it was quiet outside. I'm estimating some people around the Sumner, Pacific, Edgewood areas HAD TO HAVE SEEN THESE.  I have no idea how low they were but from where I was watching, the lights were below.  I almost called the cops because I've heard of other people doing that  - to see if anyone else had called but it was after 4 am and didn't want to sound like a crack pot.", "stats": "Occurred : 5/22/2017 04:10  (Entered as : 05222017 04:10) Reported: 5/22/2017 4:56:30 PM 16:56 Posted: 6/2/2017 Location: Sumner, WA Shape: Light Duration:20 minutes", "date_time": "5/22/17 04:10", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/134/S134223.html", "city": "Sumner", "state": "WA", "shape": "Light", "duration": "20 minutes", "summary": "Unusually low lights that broke up and flashed about 20 minutes in Sumner, WA", "posted": "6/2/17"}

{"text": "Bright white orb seen, then craft appeared shortly after. Shortly after 11 p.m. at night, I had walk out back of our apartment complex to walk to the laundry facility.  Always looking up at the sky as I normally do.   As I got closer to the laundry room door, I noticed past the other apartment building on the main road in the distance there is a river in which above that river caught my eye a giant ball coming straight down over the river.  It was very white and bright almost little yellow on the outside of it.  I can only explain that it almost look pixel like it was very very bright and something in my head just went wow that is way too big to be a shooting star and it wouldn't go in that direction straight down into the water nor would or could a star be that close to town that close and it was way too large.   At that point the hair on my entire body stood on end I immediately called my husband who was upstairs in our apartment with our Sleeping Son.  Which I will include that he did not.   After a few moments of speaking with him on the phone I had proceeded into the laundry room to switch over the laundry.  I been texted my mother.   And proceeded to walk out of the laundry room I had looked up the area in which the North Star was position that evening which coming out of the laundry room was to the left side of me way up in the sky period I then noticed strange lights in the distance I thought that's not a plane at all is it a drone and then as I was looking at it I was very focused and drawn to it I begin to feel very strange the lights are with something that caught my eye they were red and white almost in square formation going white red white red flashing oddly and as I was fixated on this thing I noticed it change shape it was hard to see because it was night time but it was like the formation of lights changed and all of a sudden it was like it had shape-shifted to a strange shape I had never seen before at that point I ask myself maybe this is a plane and then I realized that it was pretty approaching fast over my apartment building coming straight down towards me hi knew that I had to break eye contact with it for some reason I did proceeded to yell for my husband where it was warm that night and all the windows and are building are open at least in our apartment by the time I got to the front steps of my building my husband was outside I was very disoriented very nauseous I was dizzy I felt very very strange.   By that time my husband was outside and I was trying to explain to him what I had just seen and we walked out back together but the same time I began to get very anxious very nervous I was very uneasy I just wanted to go inside.  At that point something with the strange lights appeared almost in the same facility where I had seen the craft and we didn't hear anything and it was very low but it appeared to have the same exact lights shortly after we heard the sounds of what appeared to be a plane but it was definitely not a plane and he could see to that it was not a plane it was very strange it was almost like lots of s! quare flashing windows on the bottom it was really weird they like illuminated all around this craft.  There were no wing patterns on either things that we had seen and on the one that had seen by myself, there were no noises; it was eerily quiet outside.

Just before taking my exit (HSC Parkway), I noticed a spherical, shimmering object hovering over the Snook, TX, area.

This is close to Easterwood airport, so I initially thought it was a plane, then maybe a helicopter.  However, the shape was not quite right. I was driving, so my attention wavered from the object to the road.  It was a bright, clear day and I noticed no unusual sounds or nearby objects.

I knew right off the bat it was not a helicopter because I saw multiple helicopters flying around periodically at much lower altitudes.  I also ruled helicopters/other human craft out because of the uncanny movement I observed.  The craft seemed like they were interacting with one another, slowly advancing, and then moving back to their former location. I went and got my brother so that he could witness the crafts as well.  He is a very smart individual and even he did not have an explanation for what he saw.  I then spotted a third craft a little west and directly straight up in the sky.  I went outside to get a better look.  I looked directly up in the sky and the craft slowly positioned itself directly above me.  I stood in awe.  I had a feeling I was about to get abducted, but nothing happened fortunately.  It soon dawned on me that there were at least two more UFOs west of the other three. One of the two western UFOs I saw was extremely bright so I recorded, and took the best evidence I could with my smartphone.  I am overwhelmed with confusion and I want to know more.

When I first saw the light {my window faces south} it was traveling from the west heading east you know California to New York and as soon as It was almost above me it started heading south-east for about 5 seconds and then turned south heading away from me until it diapered behind some clouds.  It travelled that distance in about 30 seconds.  I realize now that the brightness of the light never changed even when it was traveling away from me and only dimed when it went behind some clouds.  I live near an airport and see planes come and go all the time.  I used to work at that airport and so what I am saying is I think I know planes fairly well.

Well as the fighter jets aproached the light, the light disappeared for about 2-3 minutes. Enough time for my dad to jump up and for me to grab the binoculars from the house.  Came back out and the light appeared again but this time going exceptionally fast South (toward the canadian border) and was gone.

I screenshotted what was on my screen and made sure the video of the incident was saved.  My neighbors about 45 minutes ago messaged me and stated that they could see what appeared to be the northern lights which is very very odd considering we are smothered with light pollution from Canadas \"Chemical Valley\".   We went outside and only saw a streak about in the same area as the jets were headed and going north east to west.  Had a greenish tint to it but nothing extremely noticible to the naked eye.

I was coming out of our post office and saw many people standing in the road where it branched to the right and then up a slight hill to the left.  This was a rural mountain village with dirt roads.  Some of the people were friends.  They were all just standing still watching something, quietly talking and I went to see what they were looking at.  Ahead on the left branch of the road...actually above the road... maybe 50 or 60 feet off the ground was a glowing ball of pink light and in the center of it, the light was a turquoise blue. It was a gaseous thing, with no structure.  The intensity of the ball of pink did not increase or decrease in light or in color.  It was luminous but did not illumine anything around it. Neither did it move in any direction.  I just was suspended about the road and may have been about 500 feet from where everyone was standing.  No one walked toward it.  There were two houses off the road on the left side, one occupied and the other was empty at that time.  (A week or so later my boyfriend, my son and myself moved into it.)  I joined the group of people watching... and asked a friend how long it had been there.  He said he was not sure but so and so had been watch it for a half hour.  He had been there another 30 minutes.   So I joined in watching, mostly silently.... I remember thinking, \"If this is a UFO... I am not feeling anything.  Not excited, not frightened, just ordinary.  What it is?  I don't know.\"   After a while I got tired of watching ... wondered if it was fading a bit... but could not tell.  So i left and went back to the group house where we had a room.

{"text": "Airplane changes to red orb before my eyes, does incredible flying moves, then changes back to an airplane. I went out back to smoke a cigarette while on the phone with a friend of mine.  I noticed what appeared to be an aircraft, very low flying coming from the east and heading west in front of me.  A rain storm was just hitting my area so it would have been normal for a low flying plane.   I recognized it as a plane because I noticed the red steady light and the green flashing light.   Suddenly, the red light dropped straight down and was out of view behind an enormous tree, about 4 house lengths from where I was standing,  I interrupted my friend who was speaking at the time and started explaining to him what I was seeing because I couldn't believe it.  The plane instantly became a red glowing orb and was doing a figure 8 pattern behind the tree in front of me, it would drop down heading west then pull up and around and head east over the top of the tree where I could see it.  It did this a couple of times - then as it was heading west again above the tree it stopped dead! in front of me.  I couldn't move, a part of me thought to run inside but my body wouldn't move.  It stayed still in front of me for a count of about 7 seconds I would say, then it instantly became an \"airplane\" again with the blinking green light and continued west in the same straight \"flight\" pattern it had been on initially.  The orb was a constant red light - not flashing and it's edges were fuzzy.   Also, when it stopped in front of me there was what appeared to be a dark line through the center of the orb.  It's hard to say how close the object was to me, but after seeing the area in the daylight today, I'm thinking that it was probably a 1/4 to a 1/2 mile away from me, over the main intersection in our town.

{"text": "Large glowing orb like craft over New Iberia. It was almost 5:50 AM when I went out my back door and into the garden to water my plants.  This time of day is usually very dark outside and sunrise would be approaching in about 30 minutes.  I usually look at the stars as soon as I come outside, but this morning a bright ball of light immediately caught my eye. At first I stood on my step staring and thinking how odd.  My brain ran through many possible reasons why I could see this bright round shape; is there a planet really close to us, was it a search helicopter in the distance, a weird street light off in the distance, anything that I could think of.  I stepped of the step and walked closer to the fence to see if I could get a better angle, possibly giving it a reference point or position.  It looked to be past the bayou, and possibly past the park.  Then it moved, very swiftly to the left and up. I froze blinking my eyes. Immediately telling myself no, nope, there is no way you are seeing things. Then it moved again to the right.  Now I\u00a0 am retreating back to my steps. I stood there staring and then I checked the surrounding sky.  I could see stars, street lamps, trees, everything as normal, but nothing was as large as this object.   Then the moment came when I thought to myself, does it know that I am staring at it? I shook my head a! nd went back inside, almost had my daughter come outside to verify it.  I decided against that notion, I didn't want to worry her and also it was time for her to leave for school.  Made sure she was ready and out the door and I went right back outside to the garden to see if it still was there.  It was and this time I took photos. I noticed in the photos it is not as prominent or as large as it was to me standing there. I moved to a different spot to gain a better angle.  Still it sat in the same spot.  As the sun started to rise i thought that it would disappear into the light within a few minutes.  Minutes passed and I could still see it just as clear and now with little shimmers of metal.  The object stayed the same shape the whole time, and no lights flashed that I saw.  I started to water my garden and try and watch it at the same time.  I noticed that it started to move up and I had to reposition a few times to track it through the trees.  Then it slowly moved right more and then some more.  I watched this object for nearly an hour, taking photos and video clips periodically.  Around 7AM, I went\u00a0 back into my home where I\u00a0 was for about 30 minutes.

{"text": "Lights inside and outside with scratching noises. I was camping on my land in Birch Tree, Missouri.  I was asleep in the RV, it was 1:45 AM, Tuesday May 30, 2017, when I was suddenly awake.  I did not know immediately why I had woke up, but as I lay there, looking out of the window I noticed a very large, very bright star above the trees.  It was about four times larger than the other stars and bright like a stadium light. I had all the windows and blinds open that night to allow the breeze to keep me cool.  I watched the \u201cstar\u201d thinking that I had never seen one so brilliant before, and suddenly four lights came out of the \u201cstar.\u201d  I watched, stunned, as these four lights began blinking or pulsing and flew around the early morning sky.  The large light, which I had thought a star, stayed higher in the sky, but the four pulsating lights flew lower, closer to the ground.  The where perhaps 100 feet or so above the earth.  They were whitish in color, not as bright as the original but they were blinking or pulsating, not sure how to describe it, and flying not randomly but back and forth like they were searching. I was paralyzed with fear, not wanting them to know that I was there.  Suddenly, in a fraction of a second, everything around me flashed very bright then dark again.  I quietly get up and close all the windows and blinds, hoping to go unnoticed to the four flying \u201corbs.\u201d  They were not really round, rectangle box shaped with rounded corners.  I laid back down, so I could peak under the curtains and that is when I noticed the blinking round light inside of my RV. I was really doubting my own eyes at this point. It was above me in the corner of the RV.  I was hoping that there was a hole in the roof.  I looked around me and everything inside was very dark except the glowing round light in the corner of the ceiling in the RV. This whole thing had been going on for about twenty minutes.  I was more frightened than I could ever remember.  I felt helpless against these lights.  That is when the RV moved, I was hoping a bear had pushed against it.  Then I heard the clawing and scratching coming from the left rear (across from the round light).  I was again hoping that it was a bear, armadillo or very large mice trying to get in. I finally just snapped out of my motionless state and grabbed one of the headlamps that I had close by and turned it on.  The round pulsing light was gone, the noise stopped and everything appeared normal.  I at 2:00 AM telling them what I was seeing.  My mind fought to find rational reasons for what was going on.  I turned the light back out around 2:30 and laid back down. I peeked under the curtain and saw the large \u201cstar\u201d still in the sky.  The round light that was inside my RV did not return neither did the scratching noises. I had my two cats with me, one of them hid and the other stayed with me and was very nervous.

{"text": "Bright light chased by Military Jet at Giant Rock during Contact in the Desert 2017. While on a UFO night-watch at Giant Rock with participants attending the Contact in the Desert event, approximately 50 of us gathered to watch the sky and share at least 15 pairs of Generation 3 military goggles provided by the host of the event. At approximately 10pm, a few people noticed a bright red-orange point of light glowing constantly bright, not blinking and moving from one field of view to another in between the two giant rocks and hills.  I and approximately 10 others joined the observers to catch a quick glimpse before it left our field of view. At this time, for approximately 1-2 minutes, I observed this light through the goggles.  The first thing I did was adjust the depth of field in the goggles.  The goggles were in focus for high altitude focus, making the stars above look very clear.  To view this object up close, I had to lens all the way to the closest depth to see the object clearly. What I saw during the time the focus was clear was a diamond shape with sides very close to being equal all the way around.  I could see definition in the object enough to make out brighter areas in all four corners of the object and once more in the middle.  In the spaces in-between, it glowed with less intensity.  Once the object was out of view from being behind the rock, I immediately drew what I saw on paper and shared it with the event host. Approximately one minute after, in the same area we saw the diamond craft fly from left to right in our view, now I saw three aircrafts following the same route.  I am aware that military aircraft blink with multiple flashes in quick succession, whereas commercial and personal planes blink once.  This is how I came to my conclusion. Moments after we noticed the above mentioned aircrafts, a large bright light appearing red-orange emerged from over the hill we stood below.  The light zoomed quickly over our heads at the height of approximately 1000 ft.  I remember noticing that there was no sound coming from the light. A moment later, following the light, emerged a military jet craft making loud noise as it flew by us.  The jet seemed to be chasing the light.  The light flew straight towards the hills to our other side, and the jet chased it until they could not be seen with my physical sight. One of the group participants using his own goggle recorded from his device a video, with no sound, showing the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports about the same event.

We were all gathered at the South side of the Giant Rock, just on the side of the paved area.  I had sensed something close by at same time the Guide pointed to the area of sky behind the Giant Rock.  The window of view was very narrow, between Giant Rock and the smaller rock at the East side of it.   At that point, I didn't have a NVG on hand, the object was very large, visible to the naked eye.  A girl with NVG on hand handed it to me to confirm the object is a UFO as she was new to it and not sure how to use the NVG.  I took the NVG and focused it to a clear view as it was blurry at that point.   With NVG now, I observed the object for about 2min, flying West/Southwest towards and behind the Spy Mountain.  It had a Diamond shape around it with a round center and a much smaller round darker area! at the 1/3 point from the bottom. It had a very pale orange tint to it at this point.   Soon after it disappeared behind the Spy Mountain, the 2 helicopters showed up from the Northeast side across the valley, and next thing we saw was one of them chasing the UFO going towards South from behind the mountain.

It was small and approximately mid way between my viewpoint and the coastal village of Sangatte.   I drew my wife's attention to it and we could not understand what it was.

At no time did the object move either up or down or in any direction.   At first my wife thought it was a light placed on top of Dover Castle, however it was the wrong direction and coastal haze prevented viability further than a few miles out to sea.  The object continued to twinkle for a period of about 5 minutes.   I took a number of photographs, the object appeared to be changing shape, with the two objects seeming to merge into one, which had a distinct saucer shape.

{"text": "Cloaking aircraft seen in Arden Hills, Mn. I was driving to work this morning, heading south on 35 W, taking the Hwy. 10 east exit to the Hwy. 96 exit.  At the stoplights there, I saw what looked like a typical jet airplane heading over the Hwy. 10 bridge in a northeast direction.   Today was a perfectly clear day with no clouds in the vicinity.  The craft appeared for maybe 5 seconds and then vanished out of sight.   This is the third time that I have seen a cloaking aircraft in the past two years.  Because of past sightings, if I see a flash in the sky I pay attention and do not assume it is a 'regular' airplane.   Frankly, I think there would be more reports on these sightings, if people only would pay attention.  I believe most people are desensitized to air traffic and a prime example of this was about a year ago while at a stoplight on Co. Rd.

{"text": "Bright light bigger than Venus, bobbing around in the southern sky at sunset for several minutes I am a retired medical assistant.  Last evening, I was taking photos of the sunset from the end of our property, along the county road.  Upon turning around to walk back to the house, I noticed the moon just up over the trees across the road, so took a photo of that as well.  This has become a routine for me to do after I let the dogs out and give their meds, each night at 9.  It is also part of my exercise strategy to lose weight by doing something fun.   As I continued to walk home, I noticed immediately- a very bright light straight south in the sky, under 45 degrees or so (I am not the best at calculating that). and guessing it to be under 5 miles away.  At first I figured it was a plane going to the small airport a bit more to the West.  However, the lights did not change direction, there were no red or green ones visible to me like they typically have, it was too big to be a plane, and there was no noise.   Then I noticed it was bobbing around a little, l! ike a pulsation type movement.  My next thought was that it was Venus rising, but thought I surely would have noticed it while letting the dogs out before, and it seemed a lot bigger than a planet or a star.  A sudden excitement came over me as I realized this was most likely some sort of UFO!  For about 3 minutes I stood in wonder watching it, until I remembered I had my camera in my hand, so I took a quick photo.  Unfortunately, I was in such a hurry to run back to the house to have my housemate come out and see it, I only took that one shot.

{"text": "Reoccurring light over Bonhamton in Edison, NJ. This object appears frequently over my property in the Bonhamton section of Edison, NJ.  It is a bright star-like light or even like an airplane, but it definitely is neither.  A friend was here earlier & she witnessed it.  It hung low in the sky, stationary & it has a subtle random pulsing of its light. It was there in the sky for about 2hrs.  The Big Dipper was in the sky almost directly above my house.  The UFO was in its usual location--looking at the backyard, in the sky to the back right side of the yard.   As we sat outdoors chatting, my friend kept checking on its presence.  After a couple hrs she commented that maybe it was a planet.  I have a SkyView app on my phone & it doesn't identify it as a planet or star.  Then shortly before she left, she looked and noticed it was gone.  Yet the Big Dipper was still visable in the general area which dispelled the idea of it being a planet.  She left soon after. I have a screen house on the patio with a hammock on a stand, chair, sidetable, etc., like an outdoor room.  I sleep out here on these mild evenings.   At about 4 am I witnessed a bright light low in the sky coming straight in.  I can't explain it but the way it was moving you could tell it wasn't a plane.  Initially, it was lower than I'd ever observed in the past & more centered in the sky looking over the back of the backyard (line off in the distance but not far distance) and it just hung there.

{"text": "\"Fireball\" ufo sighted over west edge of Elk River, MN, for 4-5 minutes, starting at 11:20PM on June 3rd, 2017. June 3rd, 2017 @ 11:20PM.  The 2 Witnesses (Father & Daughter) were traveling westbound on County Road 30, on the west edge of Elk River, Minnesota, just over 1-2 miles before the city border line between Elk River & Big Lake.  Upon crossing the 4-way stop intersection of Joplin Street & County Road 30, the unidentified object suddenly appeared in our view  (where the speed limit picks up from the 30mph zone before the intersection, to a 45mph zone after the intersection).   The object appeared suddenly in the wide open clear sky, at a 1 o'clock position from our westbound direction of travel.  The object would be best described as a VERY BRIGHT ORANGE \"fireball\" without a discernible shape, surrounded in a wavering BRIGHT orange \"aura.\"  The object was very low in the sky, as the few trees we passed along the north (right) hand side of County Road 30 initially obscured our view somewhat.  I would estimate the altitude of the object to have been no more than 200-300 feet off the ground at the *very* most. County Road 30 runs east/west parallel, next to and along the Mississippi river along that stretch, on the north hand side of the Mississippi river.  Distance from the intersection of Joplin&30, to the Pinewood Golf Course on Waco Street NW, is between 1-2 miles.  When the \"fireball\" suddenly appeared it was only that distance ahead of us, just a bit north of the golf course, almost directly over top of Highway 10. Highway 10 also runs the same parallel east/west as County Road 30 and the Mississippi river, just a few blocks north of County Road 30. A little more than half way from the Joplin/30 intersection to the Waco/30 intersection, is the Sherburne County Government Center to our right (north), located along the south side of Highway 10. By the time we had traveled (1 mile) westbound on County Road 30, and were directly south of the Sherburne County Government Center (which was directly to our right, north) the object had already slowly and erratically moved a little southward and was now right over the golf course on Waco Street NW.  We could clearly see the \"fireball\" had been moving southward, and was continuing to move southward.  However, the object did NOT move at a steady speed.  Instead, it was moving only a little south at a time at random intervals, stopping periodically in the sky.  Also, with each southward movement, it randomly would travel to a somewhat higher and sometimes lower altitude in the sky. (Note: County Road 30 along that stretch is perfectly straight for a few miles, and perfectly flat. NO rises or falls in the road.)   When we reached Waco Street, we turned onto Waco, and I immediately stopped the car to view the object which was nearly above us at that point.  We clearly observed from the roadside stopped as the object continued its random erratic traveling southward in short movements changing altitude up & down also with each movement, for just shy of 2 more minutes.  Also, throughout the duration of the sighting the \"fireball\" somewhat randomly increased and decreased in brightness.  Each time it moved mostly the brightness increased. Each time it paused in the sky mostly the brightness decreased.  All the while it maintained being the absolutely brightest object by *far* in the entire sky, other than the moon of course which was to the south (left) of us. Then the object, after being viewed from our stopped position at Waco & 30 for nearly 2 minutes, suddenly vanished, as instantly as it had appeared in the first place.  At the time it finally disappeared in the clear open sky, it had traveled southward enough to had crossed over the Mississippi river to the south side of the river.  From beginning to end, from Joplin/30 intersection to the time it disappeared south of the river, the entire sighting had lasted between 4-5 minutes.", "stats": "Occurred : 6/3/2017 23:20  (Entered as : 06/03/17 23:20) Reported: 6/4/2017 11:18:57 AM 11:18 Posted: 6/9/2017 Location: Elk River, MN Shape: Fireball Duration:4-5 minutes", "date_time": "6/3/17 23:20", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/134/S134431.html", "city": "Elk River", "state": "MN", "shape": "Fireball", "duration": "4-5 minutes", "summary": "\"Fireball\" ufo sighted over west edge of Elk River, MN, for 4-5 minutes starting at 11:20PM on June 3rd, 2017.", "posted": "6/9/17"}

{"text": "Strange object(s) seen over Little Neck NY Sunday morning, June 4th 2017 at 8:30 AM Sunday morning, June 4th, at appx. 8:30 AM, I was out for a walk to pick up some breakfast, and I happened to see out the left corner of my eye, a shiny type of objet which appeared to be reflecting the suns light looking eastward (towards NYC) and at first I didn't think much of it, until after I noticed another plane traveling the opposite direction. When I saw the other plane pass, the object appeared to be moving closer in my direction, & it seemed to me at second glance it may be one of those planes carrying an advertising banner - heading out to Jones beach, because I saw what appeared to be something wavy behind the object. As I stared at it a bit more, because it seemed unusual to me, I realized the object seemed to almost pause in its flight, and that's when I realize there were in fact two objects, and one appeared to be doing what I can only describe as a kabuki dance around the other object, and that's when I started seeming some orange color which appeared to be emanating from the bottom of these objects. At this point I took my cell phone out of my pocket & tried to capture some photo's and movies. I had to move to an area where the sun wouldn't quite be in my eyes because the object was west, but the sun was glaring off my back (as it was still early in the morning) and it was hard to zoom in and focus on the objects, but I did manage to capture some videos and a few stills of the objects. Upon reviewing the pictures I took, I realized how not so great cell phone cameras (at least my Samsung Note 5) seems to be a focusing on somewhat distant objects with an 8X zoom, but I do have some videos and still frames I'm happy to send along, or will attach to this report if provided. I looked at the objects slowly move across the sky from north to south slowly, seemingly doing this circle around one another routine, until at one point right before they vanished, they seemed to either merge, or one of them just vanished, and after about 8 or 9 minutes, all of a sudden, they were gone.

The oval light appeared to move slightly and vary in brightness during our observation.    We estimate the object to have been at least 50,000\u2019 in altitude and possibly much higher.  We estimate the size of the object to have been similar to a \u201ctic tac\u201d held at arm\u2019s length.  The weather conditions were clear, although very windy.

When we first noticed the object, the sun had not yet set, and the object was very large and very bright.  We initially thought it could have been helicopter or drone hovering over the nearby I-580 freeway.  However, this explanation was disproved when an airliner, flying at cruise altitude with the corresponding contrail, flew underneath the object.  We continued to observe the object for approximately 40-60 minutes.   As the sun set the light appeared to increase in altitude, dimming while doing so, and moving towards the east opposite the normal rotation of the earth and the rising moon/ stars.

{"text": "series of lights in California desert. While driving east on S22 in San Diego county, passing by the Borrego Valley Airport, myself and another party in our vehicle witness a series of perhaps 6-8 lights appear in the sky ahead of us.  As there was no proper perspective, the lights could have been far away or maybe as close as five miles.  This is an unknown.   The lights were as bright as headlights and white in color.  (The other witness thought they were \"yellowish\".)  They appeared to be moving slowly from south to north together as a unit so I assumed they were one object.  The lights faded, blinked out, or shut off in a few seconds.  I have witnessed many flare drops but they last much longer than five seconds. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) No, Peter, I have seen many, many military flare drops.  At first, I thought this was possible but the sighting was too short of duration for flares.  Flares last many minutes.  The lights appeared before us on the higway and disappeared in 3-5 seconds.  Also, the location (in or about the north Salton Sea area) is not a usual military training ground.  However as you suggested, they could have been farther away, perhaps over the Chocolate Mts., which IS a restricted govt \"bombing range.\"  Still, the short duration and the appearance that they were traveling south to north makes me dismiss that. The other witness says that I posted the wrong time.  She said it was more like 8:15 pm, not 9:15, as I reported.  That could be correct.  She also assumed that they were over Font's Point, a spot about 5-7 miles from our observation site, but I informed her of the perspective issue.  We just could no tell.  Five miles, or 25 miles? I also have some experience with viewing sky divers, as our airport (Borrego Valley) hosts the Canadian Army paratroopers twice per year.  They specialiize in night jumping, BUT they do it to practice in the dark.  THEY do not use flares.  They are all about surprising the \"enemy.\"  As I said there were 6-8 lights in a straight row.  Unlikley that jumpers could execute this so perfectly I researched the local news, MUFON, and the web in general, and have yet to see another report coinciding with mine.  I also have a small ad hoc group of local buffs.  We call ourselves the Dessert UFO Group, DUG.  No members reported anything.  I assume that you did not get a second report of this?  As I have told you in the past, I observe the  sky nightly and have become accustomed to what aircraft, with their landing lights and position lights look like.  This was not that.  The desert sky was clear so I think I can dismiss any atmosperic interference with my vision. Another mystery along with so many others.

{"text": "3 objects together and then separate during storm over Parker/Aurora, Colorado Occurred : 6/7/2017 4:45pm   Reported: 6/8/2017  Posted:  Location: Parker/Aurora, CO  Shape: 3 darker objects each with lights  Duration: 5-10 minutes  Moving 3 darker objects spotted between approx. Parker/Aurora (perhaps Smokey Hill area) area over E-470 from person in Parker/Franktown \u2013 video and video screen captures available.   Every so often, objects would rotate and project beam of light.  Perhaps 10-15 miles away from viewer.  Objects spotted and perhaps 10 mins total observation.   Speculation the objects were there before viewer spotted them initially.  Objects initially appear to be somehow connected as they undulated together in the sky as if they were connected, but later one of the objects broke pattern with the other two and did its own maneuver and then returned to the other two, and then the three of them continued maneuvers together.    Due to the undulating pattern, it is not thought they were just one object such as a dark plane with three lights (since one did separate from the two and then later rejoin) since the viewer has witnessed planes heading to or from DEN as the viewer knows the flight path over e! ast of Parker Road and basically down E-470 to DEN.  Objects went higher in elevation, lower in elevation, east, west, north, and south \u2013 moving further away and then closer in several different patterns, some looping, some more block-style in nature.  Ball lightening ruled out since ball lightening doesn\u2019t last this long.  Total movement from time noticed until they disappear into the passing storm that was hitting Aurora area at this time was maybe 10-30 miles.   This seems too far for a controlled drone or drones and drones don\u2019t seem to be able to fly in unison like objects.  Drones also don\u2019t seem to have such bright lights as object were maybe 10-15 miles away.  Objects did not appear to be metallic, but some kind of darker material, so doesn\u2019t resemble photos seen of weather balloons, and weather balloons don\u2019t seem to have lights or ones that were so bright as the objects did.   Objects were making various loops, appearing to stop in mid-air, rapidly going from left/right (West/East) but were generally following either an Easterly or North-Easterly direction.  During this same time, a large storm with hail, rain and lightning was passing from West to East north of the viewers position with the objects between the viewer and the storm.  If this was under human control, why were these maneuvers being carried out extremely close to a monster of a storm?  The viewer cannot think of any plane, drone, etc that can make such maneuvers.   iPhone 6 video was captured (2 min 45 sec) in zoomed in mode.  No rain at time.  Video shows birds flying around and trees for perspective.  Video is a bit shaky.  There was no water on the camera since it was not raining yet when the video was taken.

{"text": "My wife ((wife's name deleted)) was standing on our deck (south facing) and called me as she was wondering what a single reddish globe light in the sky was.  The object came from the south (from Westfield/Eden direction) and traveled towards us.   As the object neared, a second object (same color) appeared from the same direction.  Shortly thereafter, a third object appeared.   They appeared to be \u2018globes\u2019 and moved in a somewhat fast rate of speed.  There was no noise.  Their movement was very \u2018smooth\u2019 (no quick movements). Object 1 traveled towards us and, at one point, began ascending straight up (it disappeared).  Objects 2 and 3 passed the house (to our left look at the objects).  As they passed, I noticed what appeared to be a single light (underneath) the object.  I could make out a black shape (outline from the light) but could not distinguish what it was.  That is, they flew low enough for me to see that it did not have a bank of lights. I am confident in saying that it was not a plane as I did not see wings.  The light was bright and did not flicker or pulse.  I have seen and heard drones when deployed to Afghanistan.  This was not, in my opinion, a drone. I am forwarding a picture captured of object 2 and 3 from our deck.  I have other pictures but the size of the file would be too big to email.

We noticed some strange lights to the South South East of our area fairly low in the horizon.  At first we noticed four white lights moving slowly up and down separately from each other and within about 2 minutes the number had increased to seven.  This lasted about 15 minutes.  The lights looked to all be individual and moved slowly in an up and down pattern as well in opposite directions.  They also got brighter and dimmer, as the event was happening.  The lights appeared to be about 20 to 25 miles in the distance, and looked to be over the Prescott Valley to Dewey cities, from our position in Paulden.  After about 15 minutes the lights started moving in a southwesterly direction, and slowly vanished from our view.

It was a duel black color and there was no lights and it didn't move it just sat there.

I mean no sound anywhere.

We ended up watching this thing for about 45 minutes. But enough stage setting, this is what I saw:  It was bright and triangular shaped.  It was high up in the sky, higher than planes fly.  It moved way faster than a plane.  But the strange thing is it moved in short bursts.  When it made turns, these turns were almost immediate and in 90 degrees.  It also didn\u2019t move across the whole sky, just in the same area of space; as if testing out its speed and maneuvers.  If you held a notecard out with your arm extended and the card facing you, the area of the card would block out the area of the sky this object moved in the entire time I watched (~45 min).  The craft would sit still for amounts of time between its bursts of high speed moving.  When it did make the sharp turns it would start out fast and then slow down just before the turn.

It seemed like it was not that high (in our skies/atmosphere like any other pane would be...but this was no plane)  It was 4-5 times as big as any plane I have seen flying over me and I am 51 years old.  It was completely silent and I was looking up a little to the coast but almost over my neighboring suburb.  It was not like it was far away and just a dot or fast squiggle, this was a triangular aircraft that flew smoothly and silently in a straight line down our coast/over land coast side of Perth city.  This aircraft operated on a completely level than anything I have seen before.  IF it was a government aircraft, that scares me more than if it was extraterrestrial.  I watched it from the top of my driveway through the sky southward until it was too small to see (on the horizon that you can see over the house across the road, quite a long way) and it traveled that in about 10 or so seconds.  I had a good 3-5 second look at this thing and I am still awestruck.

{"text": "Spectacular pulsating lights forming a sphere fixed in the night sky I have never filed a report of this nature before, but I can't ignore what I saw so here goes:   I live directly on the coast, so in anticipation of last night's full moon, I settled myself on an outdoor bench that faces due east and overlooks the Atlantic ocean.  The night sky was crystal clear and even with the full moon, the stars were bright as ever.  Roughly 30 minutes into my moon watch, I noticed something \"gliding\" north to south fairly low overhead.  The light configuration was odd in that there two steady white lights spaced slightly apart with a third whitish-green light between them that seemed to pulse slightly somehow, as opposed to a blinking light on a standard aircraft.  In fact, there were no blinking lights anywhere on this object that I could see.  And it made no sound whatsoever.   As I was watching this object move further south, two larger (or lower) orange round objects moving in tandem, each with what looked like yellow and orange light striations coming up from them at an angle, also slid by overhead moving north to south and completely silent.  The first object turned slightly south eastward and began to head slowly out over the ocean.  At this point, I was still trying to believe that this was an aircraft of some sort, but the object stopped suddenly out over the water and became fixed in the sky where it also appeared to progressively become brighter and brighter until I noticed what looked like colors mixing in with the original bright white light.  I just kept staring at this thing, trying to come up with a \"logical\" explanation for what it could be. After 10 minutes or so, I took a chance and ran up to my house to grab my binoculars; I was afraid that the object would disappear if I took my eyes off of it.  But when I got back down to my bench, it was still there and I was able to see it clearly and with great detail through the binoculars.  I still can't find the right words to describe the colors I saw on/in/around the object.  They possessed a brilliance and clarity and purity like I've never seen.  They were not flashing, but rather pulsating and shifting somehow.  Red, green, blue, white, violet...  There were no shafts or beams striking out from the object.  The colors were cohesive and unified, forming a fixed sphere.  The colors shifted and morphed across the object but I never saw them stay still.  Brilliant white light lines appeared interspersed the individual colors somehow, almost like borders but not really because it all pulsed at such a high rate that these white lines were never stationary.  At one point, the ! sphere seemed to elongate into a cylinder and then it returned to a sphere. I called my husband, who was out of town, to describe to him in real time what I was looking at.  I also called my son, who lives a block away and asked him to come over to see what he thought about the odd thing.  We both watched it though binoculars for nearly an hour.  Eventually, the cold air off the water and the night moisture forced us indoors, but I went back out later to see if the object was still there...  It was gone. Neither of us have any idea what it was nor have we ever seen anything like it before.  Suffice it to say, it was spectacular.", "stats": "Occurred : 1/12/2017 19:30  (Entered as : 01/12/17 19:30) Reported: 1/13/2017 3:08:43 PM 15:08 Posted: 1/19/2017 Location: Ponce Inlet, FL Shape: Changing Duration:2 hours", "date_time": "1/12/17 19:30", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/132/S132157.html", "city": "Ponce Inlet", "state": "FL", "shape": "Changing", "duration": "2 hours", "summary": "Spectacular pulsating lights forming a sphere fixed in the night sky", "posted": "1/19/17"}

I looked up at what I believe was the North Star because of its position in the sky and brightness. From my viewpoint, I saw four lights in a square formation, to the left and just below the North Star.  They were only as bright as evening stars and constant, not blinking or flickering.  I watched them as they move in formation from the right side of the North Star to the left side.  They stayed in a square, for the most part, moving simultaneously closer to each other then away from each other making the square smaller then again larger.  While doing this, they did change places, moving from corner to corner in a clockwise direction. The west to east movement of the formation ended when at the lower right hand corner light moved out further away from being square, the only time the formation was not square.  Then all four of the lights disappeared at the same time. I did not time how long it was, but estimate it was about one to two minutes in duration.  The lights were high in the sky and my view was not obstructed when they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent and serious-minded.

{"text": "Triangle Shaped Dark Craft w/ 3 lights in the corners. I was looking up at the stars whilst sitting on my deck and thinking about light pollution.  I had to block the street lights from view and their orange glow to see the stars but they were still very clear for Chicago, and then as I was staring at the constellation Orion and Sirius, three red lights in a triangle shape with a dark barely visible frame or body above them began passing through what looked like fairly low altitude and mostly opaque clouds right in the left and center of my field of view. They seemed to appear out of nowhere and the craft appeared to be very large (about 1.5\" from my perspective and I'd estimate that it was at an altitude of 10,000 ft and approximately 10 miles away from me). It moved forward slowly bearing east to west and then only slightly but immediately it elevated and then went back down in altitude, it shifted speeds and altitudes as it passed into the orange glow reflecting up from the city.

{"text": "Green lights in Chevron form flying over Fort Collins, CO. I was letting my roommate's dog outside, when I saw a group of fluorescent green lights in the form of a chevron.  This was observed a few minutes after 23:30 MST approximately 4 blocks south of CSU Fort Collins campus.  The event lasted for 5 to 10 seconds.  It was a clear night with no clouds, stars were visible.  I was the only witness who saw this. I am a senior at Colorado State studying Civil Engineering and have a good understanding of physics, optics, and trigonometry. There were 5 to 7 lights in the formation, and were first seen 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. I was looking south when I first sighted them, and watched them move north almost directly overhead; they were 20 degrees from vertical to the east of me.  As the chevron passed over head, it started accelerating and gaining altitude, before the lights disappeared 40 to 50 degrees above the horizon looking north.  The lights were observed for a total of 100 to 120 degrees in the sky.  As the lights passed from south to north, they changed shape from a chevron into a straight line.  I live on a N-S-E-W street grid, and I can determine that the lights were traveling within 10 degrees of the N-S axis. From the observation point, the lights appeared relatively small, but much larger than a star.  The individual lights were round, with a hazy edge and appeared to be about 1/6 the size of the moon.  The chevron formation had a span of 3 moons, and stayed approximately this size for the entire duration, as they changed shape.  As the object passed overhead, it made no sounds.  The dog I was letting out did not respond to the event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent, and sober-minded.  In part, because of his technical training, we suspect he is a very capable witness.  He has submitted a very nice graphic, which illustrates the sighting, and which is posted to the NUFORC website.
